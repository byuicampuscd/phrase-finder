<p><strong><span>Procedure:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1</span></strong><span><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Turn on, and configure, the myDAQ function generator (FGEN).</span></p>
<p><span>The myDAQ f</span>unction generator produces standard sine, triangle, and square waves.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Click on the button that looks like a sine wave.</p>
<p>Set the Frequency to 300 Hz.</p>
<p>Set the Amplitude to 1 Vpp.</p>
<p>Set the DC offset to zero.</p>
<p>Ignore the other settings for now.</p>
<p><img src="Course%20Images/FGEN1.JPG" alt="Function Generator Settings" title="Function Generator Settings" /></p>
<p><span>The output signal is terminal&nbsp;</span>AO 0 on<span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span>protoboard.&nbsp; The AGND terminal is its ground reference.</p>
<p>Click on "Run."</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Turn on, and configure, the myDAQ oscilloscope (Scope).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The myDAQ o</span>scilloscope can display voltage measurements from two input channels simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the Source of channel 0 to AI 0.</p>
<p>Select the "Enabled" box for channel 0.</p>
<p>Set the Volts/Div scale to 1 V.</p>
<p>Set the Vertical Position to zero.</p>
<p>Set the Time/Div scale to 1 ms.</p>
<p>Set the Trigger Type to "Edge."</p>
<p>Set the Trigger Source to "Chan 0 Source."</p>
<p>Set the Trigger Level to zero.</p>
<p>Set the Acquisition Mode to "Run Continuously."</p>
<p>Channel 0 uses the input terminal AI 0 on the protoboard or the left channel of the 3.5mm Audio Input jack on<span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span>side of<span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span>myDAQ.&nbsp; Channel 1 uses the input terminal AI 1 on the protoboard or the right channel of the Audio Input jack.&nbsp; You will only use Channel 0 (input AI 0) during this experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect the AI 0 + oscilloscope (signal) input on the myDAQ protoboard to the AO 0 output of the function generator and the AI 0 - (ground) input to AGND.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is very important to&nbsp;<em>ALWAYS</em>&nbsp;connect the oscilloscope ground lead to the function generator ground lead as you did here.&nbsp; On bench-top instruments, both of these ground leads are connected together through the power cords and building wiring.&nbsp; If they are not connected to the same point on your circuit, a short circuit will result.&nbsp; Tuck this information away for the future.&nbsp; It will save you much grief, and possibly even embarrassment!</span></p>
<p>Click on "Run."</p>
<p><img src="Course%20Images/FGEN1.JPG" alt="Click run, Scope" title="Click run, Scope" /></p>
<p>A green sine wave, representing the measured voltage, will appear across the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Record the voltage measurements (Vp, Vpp, Vrms, frequency, and period).</li>
</ol>
<p>Read the peak voltage as the number of divisions multiplied by the number of volts per division.&nbsp; (In this case, it is 0.5 divisions * 1 V per division = 0.5 Vp.&nbsp; If you adjusted your speaker volume to a different level, your voltage measurement will be different.)</p>
<p>Select the "CH 0" box under "Display Measurements" to show the RMS (DC equivalent) voltage, the frequency, and the peak-to-peak voltage under the oscilloscope display.&nbsp; (In this case,&nbsp; 0.5 Vp = 1 Vpp = 0.35 Vrms, and the frequency is very close to 300 Hz).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the period as the number of divisions multiplied by the time per division.&nbsp; For the display shown here, there are 3.3 divisions per period.&nbsp; Multiply that 3.3 divisions by the setting of 1 ms per division, and the result is 3.3 ms for the period.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequency is the reciprocal of the period.&nbsp; The reciprocal of 3.3 ms is 303 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Listen to the tone.</p>
<p>Connect an 8 ohm speaker.&nbsp; (One terminal of a speaker goes to AO 0 and the other terminal goes to AGND.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to hear the 300 Hz tone, but the oscilloscope will not work with the speaker connected.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Adjust the frequency dial on the function generator to get an output frequency of 60 Hz.&nbsp; The speaker will sound like a motor boat.&nbsp; (If you cannot hear anything, use a slightly higher frequency, such as 100 Hz.)&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Measure and record the new frequency and period.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disconnect the speaker to make these measurements.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the Time/Div setting on the oscilloscope for a good display.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Reconnect the speaker and increase the frequency 20 kHz.&nbsp; This is the maximum frequency of the myDAQ function generator and just beyond the hearing range of most people.</li>
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Measure and record the new frequency and period.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disconnect the speaker to make these measurements.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the Time/Div setting on the oscilloscope for a good display.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Reconnect the speaker and slowly decrease the frequency until you can hear it.&nbsp; If you have a reasonably good speaker, this is the upper thresh hold of your hearing range.&nbsp; Otherwise, it is simply the upper thresh hold of your speaker's response!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Measure and record the new frequency and period.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disconnect the speaker to make these measurements.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the Time/Div setting on the oscilloscope for a good display.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Reconnect the speaker and continue decreasing the frequency until you can't here it anymore.&nbsp; This is the lower thresh hold of your hearing range.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong></strong>&nbsp; Measure and record the new frequency and period.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disconnect the speaker to make these measurements.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the Time/Div setting on the oscilloscope for a good display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion &amp; Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>What conclusions can you make? Start with the questions asked in the procedure and then answer these:</p>
<p>How could you determine the voltage and frequency with an analog oscilloscope that does not directly display the the voltage and frequency as a number?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The normal range of a young person's hearing is about 20 Hz to 20 kHz; how does your approximate hearing range on this simple test compare with the normal range?&nbsp;</p>
