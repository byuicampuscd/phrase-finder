                    <li>Understand how personal and government decision involves trade-offs, the strengths and weaknesses of the American market system, and the proper role of the government in this system; this includes the similarities and differences with
                        alternative economic systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                </ul>
            </div>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand global trade and the economic interactions of nations.</li>

            </div>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This introductory course in macroeconomics studies the national economy as a whole and its interaction with the global economy. Measurement of economic health and the use of fiscal and monetary policies to address unemployment, inflation,
                and growth are analyzed.</p>
            <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
            <p>This course has been designed to follow a weekly schedule in which students complete one lesson per week. You are expected to complete all of the learning activities for each lesson in the order they are listed. Also, you should complete each
                lesson in order and avoid skipping ahead without finishing a lesson. For example, complete all the learning activities in Lesson 01 before beginning any learning activities in Lesson 02. The instructor may shift the order of completion
                for some assignments, and may even extend the deadlines on a few assignments if circumstances warrant it for the whole class.</p>
            <p>Due dates and times for assignments may be found by accessing the Calendar tool in I-Learn. In addition, all required assignments and tests have been set up to appear in the &#x201C;Upcoming Events&#x201D; list that you will see whenever you
                log in to I-Learn. Also, all activities will have information on when the assignment or assessment opens and when it closes (due date and time). These due dates and times listed in the activity directions are based on Mountain Standard
                Time in the United States of America.</p>
            <p><span><span>No matter where you are in the world, assignments are due at the same time. The time and date an assignment is due doesn&apos;t shift according to your time zone. To help you with this, I-Learn 3 gives users the ability to adjust the time zone so that everyone can see deadlines in their own relative time.&#xA0;<strong>Each student must update&#xA0;his or her&#xA0;own time zone settings.</strong>&#xA0;</span>Update
                your settings by following the instructions in the &quot;</span><a href="http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/54703/l/507909-how-do-i-set-my-timezone" target="_blank">How Do I Set My Timezone?</a><span>&quot; tutorial.</span></p>
            <p>The deans of the colleges at BYU-Idaho have determined that the average amount of study time that students will put in per week per credit is 3 to 4 hours. So, for a 3-credit class, the deans expect students to spend on average between 9 and
                12 hours of total study time. For this course, on average, it will take students approximately 9 hours of study time to complete all the learning activities for each lesson. This is the amount of time that you should expect to put into
                this class each week if you want to get a passing &#x201C;C&#x201D; grade. Students working towards an A or B grade will usually need to put in more study time than 9 hours a week, maybe even beyond 12 hours per week. In order to keep
                up with the assignments and learn the most from this class, you should make sure you schedule about 1 to 2 hours a day to study for this class. Also, be aware that with this course, there is no &#x201C;time off&#x201D; for holidays that
                might occur during the week. Consequently, you should make sure to arrange your study schedule so that any holiday activities do not keep you from completing learning activities by the posted due dates and times.</p>
            <h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>
            <p>The course has been designed to follow a weekly schedule in which students complete one lesson per week. You are expected to complete all of the learning activities for each lesson in the order they are listed for each lesson. The instructor
                may shift the order of completion for some assignments, and may even extend the deadlines on a few assignments if circumstances warrant it for the whole class.

                be on the lesson group quiz. These questions should be answered before you meet with your group to take the group quiz. It will not be turned in for a grade, but it is essential that it is complete before you take the group quiz. You will
                take a group quiz that will have the same questions given as part of the individual preparation assignment. The group quiz will be taken together as you meet with your group on a live Google Hangouts on Air session. Instructions on how
                to take the group quiz are provided. The homework questions may be attempted three times&#xA0;with no penalty and are open book. Quizzes are also open book but each question may only be attempted once. There are no time limits imposed
                for any of these assignments.</p>
            <h3>Other Activities</h3>
            <p>In addition to the weekly homework and quiz assignments, there are other activities to better familiarize you with the material and also to allow you to ask questions and share ideas for improvement. These activities are arranged in a way
                where working through them from top-to-bottom will be most beneficial for you. Many of these activities will also be graded and will account for a portion of your final grade.</p>
            <h3>Exams</h3>
            <p>You will have a time limit of three hours to take the exam. Exams 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 50 questions worth two points each. Each exam will be counted toward your final grade.</p>
            <h4>Proctor Requirements</h4>
            <p>Each of the three exams are closed notes and must be taken in a proctored setting. Students within 30 miles of campus are expected to take the exams in the Testing Center. Students outside the 30-mile radius must find an approved proctor.</p>

                        <li>Personal honor is central to every aspect of our lives, including the BYU-Idaho experience.</li>
                        <li>Personal honor brings us joy and happiness, deepens our desire to love, serve, and lift others, and ultimately helps us to become more like the Savior.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
