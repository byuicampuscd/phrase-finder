            <h1>Course Syllabus</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, and firms make decisions on how to use limited resources. We&#x2019;ll cover supply and demand, pricing, equilibriums, and elasticity, as well as monopoly and oligopoly.</p>
            <p>This course is the more &#x201C;practical side of economics. It is designed to teach good business decisions, help students understand how companies target potential clients, and understand how legislation affects individual consumers and
                businesses.</p>
            <p>This is by no means, an &#x201C;easy&#x201D; subject. There is logic, math, and concepts that may take a while to wrap your brain around, but it is by all means, a &#x201C;worthwhile&#x201D; subject for students of any major. This course emphasizes
                the functioning of the price system and its effects on households and businesses. Students should expect to allocate at least 9-12 hours each week for this course.</p>
            <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>

            <h2>Course Schedule</h2>
            <p>The course has been designed to follow a weekly schedule in which students typically complete one lesson per week. You are expected to complete all of the learning activities for each lesson in the order they are listed for each lesson. The
                instructor may shift the order of completion for some assignments, and may even extend the deadlines on a few assignments if circumstances warrant it for the whole class.</p>

            <h4>General Weekly Schedule</h4>
            <p>Each week students are expected to have read the course material and completed the preparation phase, which includes reading the chapter(s), completing the Reading Outlines and Application assignments, and reporting your work on the Self-Assessment
                by Tuesday. Students will then attend the live class meeting/office hour with their instructor and fellow classmates (or watch the recording) and discuss their questions on the week&#x2019;s material and review the activities and assignments
                from the week prior. You will participate in the Critical Thinking discussion throughout the week. The Connect assignments, such as the homework and quizzes, are due by Friday at 11:45 pm Mountain Time(not local time).</p>
            <h2>General Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start early- Since the week&#x2019;s assignments conclude on Friday and the preparation phase of the next section is due on Tuesday, students will benefit from reading the material on the preceding Saturday.</li>
                <li>&#xA0;Allocate sufficient time (in general a minimum of 9-12 hours per week). Set specific and regular times to study the course material.</li>
                <li>Break up your studies into several sessions.</li>
                <li>Take notes as you read and seek to apply the principles.</li>
                <li>Get help early as needed, from your group members and professor.&#xA0;</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Books and Software</h2>
            <p>The McConnell, Bruce, Flynn Microeconomics 20th edition is an e-textbook for the course and is included as part of Connect. The Connect software is required to access the e-text and assignments (homework, quizzes, and exams). To purchase the
                &#x201C;Connect&#x201D; software, students may purchase it from the Bookstore using their student account or an accepted credit/debit card. You may also choose to purchase it from another online distributor with an accepted credit/debit
                card.</p>
            <p>Additionally a set of web notes has been created by the BYU-Idaho Economics Department as a supplemental resource. These notes require a student to download the free Wolfram CDF player to allow for the graphs to be interactive. The notes can
                be accessed at:&#xA0;<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<a href="https://courses.byui.edu/ECON_150/ECON_150_WebText/Course_Introduction.htm " target="_blank">https://courses.byui.edu/ECON_150/ECON_150_WebText/Course_Introduction.htm </a></p>]</span></strong> 
            <p>Instructions for registering:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Go to the web address provided by your instructor.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Click the &#x201C;Register Now&#x201D; button.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Enter your email address.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Enter your access code, select &#x201C;Buy Online&#x201D;, or you can &#x201C;Start Free Trial&#x201D; if you don&#x2019;t have an access code.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Complete the registration form, click &#x201C;Submit&#x201D;.</p>
            <p>In order to participate in online meetings and study groups, you are required to have access to a microphone and set of earphones for your computer. You will use both of these to participate in a variety of learning activities in this course.
                If you do not have these, a headset with both microphone and headphones can be purchased at a local electronics store for around $20. Generally, the sets that have a USB-port work far better than the basic RCA plug-in types.</p>
            <h2>Preperation</h2>
            <p>Your preparation prior to the group and class discussion is a key component of this course. You are expected to have read and studied the assigned reading material using the e-text in Connect and completed and submitted the accompanying Reading
                Outline. After the completing the Reading Outline, complete the Application assignment. After submitting both assignments, complete the Self-Assessment Quiz in I-Learn.</p>
            <h2>Teach One Another</h2>
            <p>After completing the preparation phase, post any questions you have about the material in the Questions for Your Classmates discussion board. Visit the board and answer your classmates&#x2019; questions, if you can. This board is a non-graded
                opportunity for students to teach and serve one another.</p>
            <p>You will also discuss lesson concepts and applications with your instructor and classmates in the Critical Thinking board throughout each week</p>
            <h2>Ponder and Prove</h2>
            <h3>Homework</h3>
            <p>Homework questions in Connect allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the material. You may check your answer on each question in the homework three times with no penalty. In addition, you may attempt the assignment a total of
                three times; however, each additional attempt will cost you 3% of your overall grade on the assignment.</p>
            <p>Homework assignments are open note/book and open neighbor. The intent is to help you better understand the principles and concepts covered in the assignment. These assignments tend to be more quantitative in nature.</p>
            <h3>Quizzes</h3>
            <p>Quizzes are also open note/book but not open neighbor and may only be attempted once. Students are allowed to use the internet to learn the general principles; however, searching for the question in an online test back is a violation of the
                honor code. Also, you may check your answer at a cost of 25% of the value of the question.</p>
            <h3>LearnSmart</h3>
            <p>Students may complete the related LearnSmart module for each chapter for an equivalent of one extra credit point on an exam. These modules must be completed by accessing the assignment under the folder and completed by the due date. Students
                who access the LearnSmart using in Connect the link on the right-hand side of the screen will not receive credit.</p>
            <h3>Exams</h3>
            <p>There are three exams throughout the semester. Exams are multiple-choice and will be taken in the testing center or in a similar proctored setting using Connect. Only Excel and a nonprogrammable calculator may be used when taking the exam.
                Makeup exams will only be given in severe emergency situations. Prior notification of your absence is essential in most circumstances. Exams will consist of terms and concepts, which are covered in the text as well as calculations such
                as those covered in the homework and quizzes. Since this exam is used in multiple sections, you will not be allowed to review the exam; however, the concepts of the top questions missed will be discussed in class meeting.</p>
            <p>You should focus on the concepts covered in the outlines, homework, and quizzes as you prepare for the exam. In addition, there is practice material for each section. These practice items are optional. It is important that even though the
                homework and quizzes are open note, you need to spend time learning the material. Students that rely on their ability to look up material instead knowing and understanding the material, tend to perform poorly on the exams.</p>
            <h4>Instructions for taking the Exams</h4>
            <p>Each of the three exams are closed notes using only a nonprogrammable calculator and must be taken in a proctored or remote proctored setting. Students within 30 miles of campus are expected to take the exams in the Testing Center. Students
                outside the 30 mile radius, have two options for taking the exams.</p>
            <p>1) Find an approved proctor and take the exam in a proctored setting. Refer to the website about details for finding a qualified proctor:&#xA0;<a href="http://www.byui.edu/testing-services/proctoring" target="_blank">http://www.byui.edu/testingservices/proctoring</a></p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the student to identify and have the proctor approved by the Testing Center within the first three weeks of the semester.</p>
            <p>2) Remote proctored exams using Tegrity</p>
            <p>Students outside the 30 mile radius desiring to take the exam by remote proctor are required to have a web camera and microphone. After setting up Tegrity, the student will request an exam password from the professor (which is different than
                the Testing Center password).</p>
            <p>Below are the steps a student would take for remote proctoring using Tegrity:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Click on &#x2018;Go to Lectures&#x2019; from the Tegrity widget for their Connect section.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. In the Tegrity Campus popup window, hover over the Tests tab on the top right.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Select &#x2018;Start a New Test&#x2019;.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Students will receive a popup if their instructor has enabled the &#x2018;Show course testing policy when students start tests&#x2019; option.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. If this is the first time the student is using this feature, they will need to accept and run the TegRunner.exe install file.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. After the installation is complete they will see the Tegrity Recorder panel (same as instructors); use the tests in this panel to ensure hardware is functioning correctly.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. For their image, students should then display identification (I-card or government issued identification card) to the webcam to prove identity.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">8. Click &#x2018;Record&#x2019;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">9. Students will then access their exam (through Connect or another website on their computer), the recording working in the background while they answer their questions.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.Once the exam is complete, the student will need to click &#x2018;Stop&#x2019; button in the Tegrity Recorder and choose to &#x2018;Upload&#x2019; the video in the background.</p>
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>Grades will be based on the points students earn from assignments, participation in online class meetings, and completion of any other learning activities assigned by the instructor. Points will be distributed according to the following percentages.</p>
            <p>Reading Outlines &amp; Applications &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;15%</p>
