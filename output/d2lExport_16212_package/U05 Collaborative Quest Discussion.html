<hr />
<p>Body image is a central issue of adolescence and even adulthood for many women.

View the following clips and share with your group the pressures you have observed in our physically obsessed culture. What suggestions or counter measures would you give to help your daughter develop a healthy body image?</p>

<p>Active participation on the discussion boards is a requirement for this course. Your timely contribution to the discussion is essential to allow others the opportunity to respond to and interact with you. You should make an initial post by the end of the first week of each unit. You will be given half the points (50% credit) for your first, well written post. You must then reply to at least two other students with substantive information about their posts to receive the other half (50%) of the points. Each student must contribute fully to the collaborative activities. This fulfills the Teach One Another requirement.</p>
