<h1>Case Study: Margaret and Weight Loss</h1>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Estimated time to complete: 90 minutes.</span></em></p>
<hr />
<div class="clearfix"><img class="left" alt="Margaret" src="Documents%20and%20Images/Margaret%20picture.png" style="float: left;" title="Margaret Picture" width="25%" />
<p>Margaret is 37 years-old. She is 5'3" and weighs 160 pounds. Her waist circumference is 38 inches and her percent body fat is 36%. She has been trying to lose weight off and on for a number of years. She has tried a variety of trendy diets, each gave her some temporary success, but she always seems to gain the weight back and sometimes even more.</p>
<p>Margaret doesn&rsquo;t enjoy exercise and hopes she can achieve her objective without having to do any physical activity. She has heard that a number of her friends are trying a low carbohydrate approach to weight loss and wonders if this might be the key to her success. She also wonders if gastric surgery may be the answer.</p>
