<p>Ben is barely a month old. Three short weeks ago, he was thrust from the dark, liquid environment of his mother's womb into a world of light and air, a world filled with emotions. As a newborn, Ben's emotional expressions are limited to grunts and the involuntary faces he makes. Even in the haze of the senses, he responds to his mother's touch and is enjoying the intimacy. The communication is simple but effective. Every parent lies in wait for their baby's first smile. The baby human's parents are wired to expect a certain level of responsiveness from their infant, but in the first month of Ben's life, a smile is just a reflex. By simply stroking his cheeks or lips, a smile will appear. But gradually over the next months, Ben will be able to feel and express a whole range of emotions which will take a lifetime to refine. His emotional journey is being shaped right here in his first relationship, with his mother. Feeling safe and loved is a good beginning for all baby humans.</p>
<p>Shortly after the first month, the baby human begins to volunteer the beginnings of a smile, especially when it's a fun game with Dad. And of course when the baby human smiles, it draws the adult's interest. The baby human's early intimate interactions with someone who loves him are crucial in giving him the ability to smile. Without that someone to interact with, the infant will be severely delayed in smiling. In fact, this early intimate contact is essential for healthy emotional development throughout the baby human's life.</p>
<p>By three months, there is a shift in the baby human's development. Brendan is more alert than he was at birth, his squeals and squawks are his way of communicating. Around this age, an important emotional change takes place. It's marked the occasion of the baby human's social smile with upturned mouth and a wrinkle around the eyes. As an adult, it is a response to attention, an invitation to play, and an awakening of sociability. Parents take advantage of this onset of sociability by taking their baby out more; it's a new phase for both mother and child as both open up the outside world. Brendan is dressed in his best for going on his first social visit.</p>
<p>As Brendan goes to new places, he is introduced to new surroundings. He gets to meet new people and interact with them; they are different from the people in his family. Take for example, Claire. She's only five weeks younger than Brendan but there is a world of different between them. In a few short weeks, she will be able to receive visitors, but not right now. Even Brendan has his limits, but smiles and fussing aren't all that Brendan can express at this age. New research shows that even a three month old has a limited but distinct repertoire of emotions.</p>
<p>At Michael Lewis' lab at Rutgers University, researchers wanted to know: what are the first emotions that the baby human can express. Three-month-old Joseph has a string attached his wrist; the string leads to a monitor. Whenever Joseph pulls on the string it turns the television on and something interesting appears. At first Joseph is mesmerized by the string itself and is oblivious to the image in front of him.</p>
<p>Then he looks up, shows surprise at what he sees. He realizes quite quickly that he is the one who is controlling the event and keeps pulling on the string. He is delighted at having this control. Then from behind the string, the researchers detach the string from the monitor. Joseph pulls and nothing happens. It doesn't take Joseph long to realize that no matter how much he pulls, it has no effect. Joseph expresses the emotion of frustration with his whole body.</p>
<p>Three-month-old Jaheara is also enjoying the joys of remote control. Then behind the screen researchers detach the string again. This time the monitor goes on and off randomly, not related at all to Jaheara's arm pull. Jaheara becomes confused and displays signs of frustration and anger. So even at this young age of three months, the baby human can feel and display the basic emotions of surprise, delight, frustration, and anger, which become more nuanced as the baby human grows.</p>
<p>Tara is four months old. Although at this age her emotional vocabulary is limited, she has no difficulty with making her feelings known. Her mother waits to hear what kind of cry it is, and whether it is a cry that needs attending. In a short time, she has learned that there are different cries. The baby human is supposed to cry, it's really the only way they have of communicating different states like: I'm hungry, I'm tired, I don't like this. Tara's cry is a distress signal, it's important for the baby human's survival to be able to communicate these different needs. Mother become attuned to their baby's emotional expressions and know how to respond accordingly. But although the baby human is attracted to their mother's face, how good are they at recognizing emotions in their parents and understanding what they mean?</p>
<p>At Albert Einstein College of Medicine, researches wanted to know at what age babies can understand the emotions of others and whether parent's emotions are easier to read than those of strangers. To find out, researchers placed babies in front of two screens. They're shown a series of men and women; some are their parents and some are strangers. On one monitor, the expression is a happy one, and on the other one a sad one. From the speaker between the two monitors, the baby either hears a happy voice or a sad voice. Researchers want to see at what age the baby human can match the happy voice with the happy face. The words are out of sink to make sure the infants are reading emotions, not just the lips.</p>
<p>Twelve-week-old Jude is shown the happy and sad face of his mother. The voice is happy and Jude looks from one image to the other and finally settles on the happy face. This suggests to the researchers that he is able to match his mother's happy voice with her happy face. Then they do the same thing with the father. Although it's his own father and he can recognize him at this age, he can't yet match the right face with the right voice, and finally loses interest.</p>
<p>At fifteen weeks, Kailey can't match the emotions in her own father's voice with his face either. But at this age when she is shown an unfamiliar woman, she is able to match the sad voice with the sad face. She can read the emotion even when it isn't her own mother. But Amy, at eighteen weeks can match her father's sad emotion in the voice with the one on his face. The researchers concluded that the baby human learns to read the emotions of their mother at around twelve weeks, other women a few weeks later, and much later of their father and other men. Researchers believe that this is probably because women expression emotions more clearly than men.</p>
<p>The baby human comes into the world with the capacity to feel and express a variety of emotions. At first the repertoire is limited to the basic emotions of joy, surprise, frustration and anger. At an early age they can also recognize emotions in others. Every interaction with the outside world evokes an emotional response. But not every child reacts in the same way. Psychologists are finding more and more that the nature of the emotional response and its intensity depend on one central aspect of the baby human's makeup.</p>
<p>Emotions are the language of infancy, the first language with which parents and infants communicate before the baby human acquires speech. But the intensity of these emotions depends on the baby human's nature. Ben's mother has been up for hours. Ben is what some mothers refer to as a difficult baby. He fusses when he's put down to sleep, he cries a lot. His three-year-old sister was never like this; to this day she seems to have a sweet disposition, never makes a fuss around bedtime and sleeps through the night. Her mother thought that all babies were like her, but what Ben's mother will have to learn is that like other animals, each baby human comes into the world with their own temperament.</p>
<p>To find out how temperament affects the baby humans' emotional responses to the world and whether it follows them over the first three years of life, researchers at Nathan Fox's lab at the University of Maryland test babies over their first three years. Four month Audrey is seated in front of a jack-in-the-box, a good toy to see how babies react when they're suddenly surprised. Audrey sits calmly and barely blinks; in fact, she finds it amusing.</p>
<p>Like Audrey, Jacob is also four months. What effect with the same jack-in-the-box have on him? The researcher tries again to see if Jacob will eventually get used to the stimulus. The second time around, Jacob trembles in anticipation and begins to cry even before the jack-in-the-box pops up. The researcher calms him before they try again; he manages a smile. But Jacob reacts accordingly to his temperament and finds it too overwhelming. When you can't talk yet, crying is a good way of telling grownups how you feel.</p>
<p>Some infants love more stimulation; some less. It all depends on their temperament. When things get to be too much, babies have some tools of their own to cope. When Maya's father gets too close, Maya looks away. That's Maya's way of telling her father she feels overstimulated. How close, how far, the amount of touching and stimulation are regulated by the emotional reactions of the baby human, and one hopes that their parents are a good match temperament-wise or are sensitive enough to pick up on their baby's cues. Sometimes an overzealous dad needs to be educated. Too much of a good thing can be stressful and Maya lets her dad know just how she feels.</p>
<p>Back at the University of Maryland, infants are brought in at nine months for the second assessment of the temperament study. This time researchers want to measure the emotions of anger, joy, and fear; all aspects of temperament. First Jack is allowed to play with a colorful toy, then a transparent barrier is put between him and the object of his desire. He sees the toy but can't reach it. No matter how frustrated Jack feels he won't' give up, and when he can't do it on his own he tries to charm the researcher into helping him. Emily, also nine months, is of a different temperament than Jack. It seems that she's more laidback. She gives it one or two tries but then gives up. And even the researcher tries to entice her again, she can't be bothered.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a puppet show makes children happy. During this part of the study, researchers want to draw joy from the babies. Emily loves the puppets and even tries to join in on the action. But when the researcher tries the same experiment on Jack, he finds the situation anything but joyful. His temperament is such that he is easily frightened, and he will have none of it. The minute the puppets are removed, he cheers up and is ready for more action.</p>
<p>Next the researchers tested the babies' reaction when something frightens them. Not surprisingly, Jack is shaken by the scary mask so they bring on the clown mask and this one really pushes him past his limit. But Emily is very interested, she finds the clown amusing and that it's just a continuation of the previous entertainment. As for the more ominous mask, she just takes it in stride and adopts a wait-and-see attitude. Why does Emily react differently than Jack? Where does the different reside?</p>
<p>To find out, Doctor Peter Marshall places an EEG cap on Emily. The electrodes on the cap will measure the electrical signals produced by her brain in response to a series of sounds. A researcher distracts Emily while they take a baseline reading of her brain. Then she hears a series of tones, the series consists of regular beeps interspersed with other sounds that are different. How the brain reacts to sudden new stimuli is recorded. Emily seems to have more activity in her right frontal lobe. This kind of reading is associated with children who have a more subdued personality. But what has fascinated researchers is that babies with exuberant temperaments show an exaggerated response on the other side of the brain, in the left frontal lobe. In test after test, this groundbreaking research has shed light on the neurobiological basis of restraint and exuberance.</p>
<p>Jack overreacts so much that he won't allow the cap to be put on. One can only guess what the alpha waves in his frontal lobe are showing. But is emotional temperament constant over time? Will the temperament that Elizabeth exhibits at six months be the same as when she is older? Will the curious toddler remain curious forever; the lounger, the joker, the dreamer, the industrious one? Are they destined to carry these temperament traits into the years ahead? And what about the worrier, and even the shy one?</p>
<p>To find out, researchers at Nathan Fox's lab bring back children previously tested for the final part of the long term study. Twenty-four month Ethan and his mother are introduced to the risk room to see how Ethan reacts to various stressful situations. A stranger enters; in this first part of the study what researchers measure is how long it takes for the child, if at all, to overcome shyness and warm up to the stranger. Eventually when the so-called stranger pulls out some inviting toys, Ethan overcomes his shyness and takes the risk. Once he's comfortable with the stranger, they continue with the next part of the study.</p>
<p>Researchers wanted to find out how children react to unpredictable situations, and the toy robot is certainly unpredictable with its noises and sudden movements. The robot proves too much for Ethan, even with his mother by his side. For the next part of the study, Ethan is tested on a set of stairs to see if he's a risk taker. The researcher demonstrates and invites Ethan to try. But Ethan is a cautious little boy; one foot and then the other. He gets over the hurdle in his own way. Emboldened by his success, he does it again. Upon reflection, he turns to his mother. He wants her to recognize how big a risk he took.</p>
<p>Twenty-four month Raphael, who's the same age as Ethan, reacts differently. He's a child that likes to take risks. But when the robot arrives, he's not such a hero. Unpredictable situations that he has no control over terrify him. Thirty-five month Abby has a totally different temperament. She takes charge of the situation and even gives instructions to the researcher before leaping off the stairs. When the robot appears, Abby is intrigued but only up to a point. She needs to hold onto the researcher for courage. The final part of this study shows that the amount of risk the child will take depends on individual temperament; and as the researchers gather all of the findings in the long term study, they expect to find that children who are the temperamental extremes at four months will demonstrate the same tendencies at nine months and twenty-four months. But does early temperament seal the baby human's fate? Will their childhood temperament govern their behavior for life?</p>
<p>The emotional journey of the baby human begins with the early emotions of surprise, frustration, joy, anger and fear. Gradually they learn to recognize emotions in others, but babies come into the world with their own unique temperament. And it is this temperament that governs the way they deal with and express their emotions. So what happens when that temperament collides with the outside world?</p>
<p>Eighteen month Bronwyn is happily playing with her toys until her mother tells her time for a snack. Bronwyn doesn't want to tear herself away but her mother insists, and asks her to help clean up. The baby human is often interrupted just when it seems she's having the most fun. It requires the baby human to comply with someone else's wishes. The snack seems so far away as Bronwyn has to suffer getting dressed, getting washed up. These are frustrating moments in the baby human's life, but what makes a child overcome their emotional reactions and comply? Is it only a question of discipline? To what extent do the baby human's compliance depend on their temperament?</p>
<p>Nine month Jack has returned for a visit to the University of Maryland's ongoing temperament study. At the beginning of the session, Jack's mother is trying to get Jack to read his own book. In this part of the study, Doctor Amie Hane wants to chart the relationship between temperament and parenting. Then a plant designed to pique the baby human's curiosity is brought in. Jack's mother is told to treat the plant as if it were a dangerous electrical outlet and not let him touch the plant. Because of his intense temperament, Jack finds it impossible to restrain himself despite his mother's repeated requests. Wild alligators and turtles can't keep Jack away from the plant.</p>
<p>Nine month Emily who previously exhibited a laidback temperament has also returned to the lab. Emily's mother has no problem with getting Emily to play quietly with her book. In comes the dangerous plant. Emily gets her first warning. Unlike Jack, that's all she needs. She completely forgets about the temptation. Because of Emily's easygoing temperament, her mother doesn't have to work hard to get her to comply and can enjoy her magazine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack's mother is working overtime. This study shows that parenting is heavily influenced by the child's temperament. If a child wants their child to cooperate, they have to take their temperament into consideration. With Jack's temperament, the only solution is to remove the plant from his sight.</p>
<p>There is a perpetually emotional dance between parent and child. Even though the baby human reacts to the world according to their temperament, these reactions aren't necessarily permanent. They can be patiently modified by an understanding parent. How the parent responds to the baby human's calls for attention, the way they encourage and prohibit all contribute to shaping the baby human's emotional response to the world.</p>
<p>Jasmine doesn't like it when her mother leaves her alone. Even though there are toys to play with, she'd rather have her mother's company. First she calls out to get her mother's attention. Her mother responds to her by calling back to her from the kitchen, but that's not enough for Jasmine. She begins her protest in earnest and starts to fuss. Jasmine's mother keeps talking, she tries to calm Jasmine by keeping contact with her voice. Her mother's playful style of soothing Jasmine eases her distress and Jasmine in turn is learning from her mother how to regulate her temper.</p>
<p>At Joe Campos' lab at Berkeley, researchers wanted to see whether babies can use the emotional information in an adult's facial expressions to decide how to react, especially in uncertain situations. Ten month Nina has come to the lab with her mother. Her mother is at the deep end of a visual cliff. Nina is placed at the shallow end and must crawl across to her mother. As she approaches what appears to be a drop off, she is unsure and looks to her mother to see if it's safe to cross. Her mother is instructed to prevent her from coming across using only her facial expressions. Nina reads the emotions in her mother's face and retreats. Next time her mother is told to invite her Nina across the visual cliff only by giving her an encouraging smile. Nina understands what the smile means and this time does not hesitate. Researchers have determined that by ten months, babies have learned to look to the emotional expressions in their parents' face for guidance. And parents in turn know that they have a powerful tool for influencing their children.</p>
<p>Jasmine's father has just come home from work and her mother has taken the opportunity to sneak into the kitchen to fix dinner. As Jasmine complains, her father does his best to distract her. Over the past nine months, he has become familiar with her temperament and has learned to adjust his responses. He knows what is likely to soothe his daughter; there's a special melody that usually does the trick. So although it's true that each baby human comes into the world with their own temperament, their response to the world is not entirely fixed for life. It is molded, helped to evolve and grow by the way people around them react to their temperament. But how does the baby human cope when help isn't available?</p>
<p>All human beings respond to stress according to their own temperament, and what could be more stressful than having an injection? For the most part in the first year of life, it's the adults in the baby human's life that help control their emotions. Steven has come for his six month vaccination shot. Although he's had one of these before, he's forgotten how bad it can be. He stares at the needle with great curiosity. The way mothers deal with their baby's temperament helps give their children strategies for managing a whole range of emotions. As Steven cries, his mother tries to lessen the stress by soothing him. She brings him face to face, hoping that this mutual gaze will make Steven forget the residual pain in his sore leg. This redirecting of attention when stress becomes overwhelming will come in handy throughout his life. Steven's mother is instinctively teaching him a strategy for self-comfort. But what happens when mother isn't there to take the pain away? Do babies come with build-in mechanisms for comforting themselves?</p>
<p>That's what researchers at the University of Pennsylvania wanted to find out. Six month Vivian is visiting the University of Pennsylvania's infant lab. She's enjoying exploring things with her hands but not for long. Because infants often get into situations where their arms are restrained, sometimes accidently, sometimes on purpose, researchers wanted to see how babies with different temperaments react to such a situation. The researcher gently holds Vivian's hands down, something guaranteed to upset most babies. Vivian tries to squirm out of the situation and begins to fuss. Then to see whether her temperament is one that can be distracted when upset, they show Vivian a tape of baby face. Vivian forgets that her arms are restrained and is mesmerized by the pictures. When the video tapes stops, she begins to fuss. Soon she finds a way of comforting herself by chewing on the researchers as a substitute for sucking on her thumb.</p>
<p>Nine month George is very distraught by the arm restraints. When the tape goes on he immediately reacts and forgets his situation for a moment. When the tape goes off, he's back to being upset. He gets so upset that the researcher releases his arms. To calm himself down since there's no entertainment to distract him, he entertains himself. So researchers have concluded that the emotions of infants can be regulated both by external distraction and by various distinct coping tools of their own.</p>
<p>The Halloween tradition of going door to door for candy can be an extremely stressful occasion for two year olds. Jacob and Jayden are terrified by their overzealous neighbor and forget all about the candy they had dreamt of. They call to their parents for help. Leaving a situation when it's too hard to handle is a good strategy, but what other resources for controlling their own anxiety does the baby human have in the second year of life?</p>
<p>Two year old Ella has come to Sarah Mangelsdorf's lab at the University of Illinois. Her father is told to ignore his daughter; Ella isn't used to this treatment. Researchers wanted to see what resources two year olds call upon when left to deal with their emotions by themselves when they can't get help from an adult. In this study, they're looking at the emotion of fear. Ella is in for a big surprise. There's no mistaking how she feels when the tarantula seems to come alive. The tarantula is activated by a clap or sudden noise. Ella wants to see it drop but is caught between her desire and her fear. Maybe if she's the one to control it, it won't be so frightening. Seeing that her father is not help in this situation, she suddenly remembers a spider's song as a strategy to overcome her fear. Gradually researchers are discovering that by the time toddlers have reached twenty-four months, they have acquired some coping skills of their own to deal with fear.</p>
<p>Eighteen month old Bronwyn is trying to explain that she can't open her toy chest. Now that she can say a few words, she calls on her mother to help her. Language helps the baby human increase their repertoire of expressing their feelings. Frustration seems to go hand in hand with being a baby human. Bronwyn's mother coaches her, patiently instructing and encouraging her to open the drawer on her own. She's teaching her perseverance and how to channel her frustration. With adult help, Bronwyn succeeds. But what coping skills do toddlers call upon when there's not adult to guide them through life's exasperating moments? And how does temperament affect these skills?</p>
<p>What can be more frustrating than trying to get crackers out a sealed bag when you're two-and-a-half years old? That's the study that researchers at Sarah Mangelsdorf's lab invented to see how toddlers of different temperaments deal with situations. Parents are told to ignore the child. What parent hasn't heard these grunts before? It's a situation that mimics real life, as if the parent is busy and can't immediately meet the child's need. The result is frustration on the child's part. Children express their frustration in a variety of ways. There's the dramatic approach, there's the patient and methodical approach, and then there's Ella. Researchers measure how long the toddlers persevere and what creative strategies they use to alleviate their frustration. The study shows that different children adopt their own style of controlling their feelings when faced with frustrations; and that some temperaments cope better than others. So the baby human can express a range of emotions and feelings at a very early age. But at a certain age, a new set of emotions appear which catapult the baby human into a whole new dramatic realm.</p>
<p>As the baby human grows, so does the array of feelings they experience; the early emotions of surprise, anger, joy, fear, gradually grow more shades. There is still a whole field of emotions they have not experienced yet: embarrassment, pride, shame. These are called the self-conscious emotions. So when do they first appear in the baby human?</p>
<p>Michael Lewis' lab at Rutgers University has devoted much of their research to the field of these self-conscious emotions. The first step is to establish at what age children acquire consciousness of self. Michael is fourteen months. A researcher dabs a bit of lipstick on the end of his nose. Then he is placed in front of a mirror to see if he can recognize himself. He is still too young to know that it is him in the mirror. He thinks it's another little boy and goes to find him.</p>
<p>Mohammad is a few months older than Michael. Will he notice the red dot? Mohammad just stares at the mirror; at seventeen months he is still too young to be aware of himself. Hunter is twenty-four months. She looks in the mirror and is taken aback. When she looks a second time, she rubs her nose. Twenty-two month Sheara also notices the mark on her nose. By touching her nose, it suggests that she recognizes herself in the mirror and has reached the age of self-consciousness. This research shows that this stage usually appears by the time a child has reached the age of two.</p>
<p>Then Sheara is invited to take part in the next stage of the experiments. Researchers wanted to know if the emotion of embarrassment goes hand in hand with self-recognition. Sheara is given bright, exciting toys to play with. Suddenly the researcher and Sheara's father call out her name and point at her. The earliest form of embarrassment is when you are the center of attention. Sheara stops what she is doing, smiles sheepishly and touches her body, the classic signs of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Then seventeen month Mohammad is tested; he is one of the children that did not recognize himself in the mirror. No matter how much the researcher and his mother point at him and call his name, he does not react with embarrassment. Researchers conclude that only when a toddler recognizes himself does the self-consciousness of embarrassment appear. But embarrassment has many faces and is also related to the baby human's temperament, and sometimes it's just too much to handle.</p>
<p>Two-and-a-half year old Kevin is busy drawing at the kitchen table. He is given full reign to his artistic imagination. The medium he has chosen to express himself is colored crayons. It's an abstract composition and needs some explanation. Part of any artist's process is sharing it with an appreciative audience. When his mother makes a fuss over his drawing and sings his praises, it makes Kevin happy. It's a first hint of a new emotion: pride. When do children experience pride and its opposite, shame? What provokes those feelings and how are they expressed?</p>
<p>Those are the questions that Michael Lewis at Rutgers University is asking as a part of his continuing studies on self-conscious emotions. Three year old Alanna is about to do a series of puzzles. What Alanna doesn't know is that the researcher is controlling the clock and the test is rigged. The first time she is allowed to complete the puzzle. Alanna sees that she has beaten the clock; her whole body shows signs of pride at her accomplishment. On the second puzzle, the researcher manipulates the clock so that it rings before Alanna finishes the puzzle. Alanna realizes that she has failed; her expression is downcast and she can't bring herself to make eye contact with researcher, all signs of shame.</p>
<p>But this expression of shame has many faces. Sometimes it is tinged with embarrassment, sometimes a refusal to admit failure. Again, it all depends on temperament. And even though pride may have many expressions, there is no mistaking it when it appears. Researchers concluded that only when the baby human becomes aware of their own accomplishments and failures do the emotions of pride and shame emerge.</p>
<p>The emotional journey of the baby human begins in the first few moments of life and lasts a lifetime. It is in relationship with others that the journey evolves. Researchers have discovered that each child comes into the world with their own temperament. But temperament is not destiny. The way a compassionate adult helps a child overcome difficult moments teaches them coping skills. At around eighteen months when they recognize themselves for the first time, a whole new door opens. More complex emotions appear: embarrassment, shame, and pride are added to the repertoire. And throughout the journey they give and receive love, the most important emotion of all, and one that will take a lifetime for the baby human to explore.</p>
