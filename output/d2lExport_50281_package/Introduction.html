<h1>Gateway Foundations "Learning Model" Seminar</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction to Assignment</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Gateway Foundations "Learning Model" seminar. All students who are enrolled in FDSCI 101 are required to complete this seminar. This seminar will take about 45 minutes to an hour to complete. <span> Please complete this before moving on to Lesson Two of this course.</span> For an understanding of this assignment and its requirements, carefully read the instructions below.</p>
<h2>What are the Gateway Foundations Seminars Series?</h2>
<p>BYU-Idaho has developed four separate seminars that are foundational to a BYU-Idaho education. Each seminar is attached as a requirement to one of four Foundations courses as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h4>Gateway Foundations Course</h4>
</td>
<td>
<h4>Required Gateway Seminar</h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FDSCI 101 - Science Foundations</td>
<td>"Learning Model"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FDAMF 101 - American Foundations</td>
<td>"Realize the Vision"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FDENG 101- Writing Foundations</td>
<td>"Library Resources"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FDMAT 108 - Math for the Real World</td>
<td>"Academic Advising"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These learning opportunities are called "seminars" because those who take these Foundations courses on campus (rather than online) are expected to attend a seminar conducted by BYU-Idaho students. However, you will complete the "Learning Model" seminar requirement online as part of your online FDSCI 101 course.</p>
<h2>Seminar Requirement Overview</h2>
<p>The BYU-Idaho Learning Model has been developed to assist us in better understanding the eternal principles that will lead to greater knowledge and inspiration as we "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118). These principles are:</p>
<p>Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise faith in Christ as a principle of action and power</li>
<li>Understand that true teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost</li>
<li>Lay hold upon the word of God as found in the holy scriptures and in the words of the prophets</li>
<li>Act for themselves and accept responsibility for learning and teaching</li>
<li>Love, serve, and teach one another</li>
</ol>
<p>At BYU-Idaho, these inspired principles are applied to the three process steps of: 1) Prepare, 2) Teach One Another, and 3) Prove/Ponder.</p>
<p>In this seminar you will further explore these process steps and principles and better understand how to implement them into all your learning experiences. The emphasis of this seminar is placed on the five eternal principles of the Learning Model rather than the three process steps. Your understanding of the process steps is enhanced naturally as you apply them as the basic structure of all BYU-Idaho courses.</p>

<h2>Seminar Expectations and Requirements</h2>
<p>This seminar will have you complete the following:</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>First, you will watch a 3&frac12; minute video segment that introduces the BYU-Idaho Learning Model and explains its benefits.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Second, you will be asked to deepen your understanding of the Learning Model principles by completing a series of learning activities and an assessment for at least two of the five principles. Go to the next page to find Step 2: Learning Model Principles. You are invited to explore all five principles for greater understanding and application as you desire; but the expected requirement is to thoroughly study and ponder deeply at least two of the listed principles.</p>
<p>For each principle that you choose, you will be given a series of learning activities to complete such as scripture references to look up, relevant quotes to read or video messages to watch. You may choose to select those principles that you are most interested in, or that you would like to gain greater understanding of, or that you struggle with the most to apply in your life. Please take the quiz for each Learning Model principle that you study.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>After you have completed the learning activities and assessments for at least two of the Learning Model principles, there is a final learning assessment to complete before you move onto Lesson 02. You will find the Final assessment after the Learning Model Principles page. Access the final assessment after you have completed the other assignments.</p>
