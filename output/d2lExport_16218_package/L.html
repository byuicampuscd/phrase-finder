            <h1>Divorce &amp; Remarriage</h1>
            <hr>
            <p style="align: center;"><strong><em>&quot;Somehow forgiveness, with love and tolerance, accomplishes miracles that can happen in no other way.&quot;</em></strong> <em>-President Gordon B. Hinckley<img alt="Mother and kids" class="right" src="../family.jpg" title="Mother and kids" width="33%"></em></p>
            <p>Last week we discussed several challenges and opportunities associated with parenting. But few parenting discussions address the special challenges associated with divorce and blended families.</p>
            <p>Blended families have challenges on several fronts: they resulted from a &quot;failure&quot; in an earlier marriage, there are almost always continued ties of some sort, and there are few useful models of how a blended family ought to be constructed.
                (&apos;Sorry, the Brady Bunch just won&apos;t cut it.)</p>
            <p>Here we will address some of the effects of divorce and remarriage&#x2014;blending of families. Rather than focusing on several of the obvious negative outcomes of divorce we will look at how we can respond to many of them.</p>
            <h2>Lesson Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Our objectives for this lesson include:</p>
            <p>

            <h2>Learning Activities</h2>
            <h3>Read</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Read chapter 14 of the text, &quot;<strong>Separation and Divorce</strong>&quot;. Examine some of the trends regarding divorce, paying special attention to some of the statistics offered. Then answer this question for yourself: What are
                    the odds of your being divorced, and what control do you have over those odds? Note also that there are several steps to divorce. As you might have noticed from your own observations, it does not happen all at once. Consider, then,
                    the costs of marital separation as a way of responding to frustrations or disappointments in marriage. (1 hour)</li>
                <li>Read also chapter 15, &quot;<strong>Remarriage and Step families</strong>&quot;. Come prepared to examine some of the special challenges once faces with remarriage, and some of the particular strategies you would recommend for adults seeking
                    to create an effective and lasting blended family. (1 hour)</li>
                <li>Take the <strong>Reading Quiz</strong></li>
                <li>Review the case from Sager and his colleagues, titled &quot;<a href="../Sager,%20et%20al%20-%20Formation%20of%20a%20Remarried%20Family.pdf" target="_blank" title="Formation of a Remarried Family">Formation of a Remarried Family</a> &quot;,
                    first chapter of the book &quot;Treating the Remarried Family&quot;. How do you feel toward each of these family members? Do you naturally find yourself siding with any particular members of the family? Why? What type of advice would
                    you offer these family members? Take notes for yourself and be prepared to discuss in detail.</li>
                <li>Read &quot;<a href="../Sager,%20et%20al%20-%20Differences%20Between%20Nuclear%20and%20Remarried%20Families.pdf" target="_blank" title="Differences Between Nuclear and Remarried Families">Differences Between Nuclear and Remarried Families</a>&quot;,
                    from the same book &quot;Treating the Remarried Family&quot;. We have been addressing the needs and structures of families throughout the semester. In this document focus on the differences&#x2014;the tasks that are somewhat unique
                    or modified in the blended family. Ask yourself, &quot;Why would this be different for the blended family?&quot; and come prepared to discuss. (1 hour)</li>
