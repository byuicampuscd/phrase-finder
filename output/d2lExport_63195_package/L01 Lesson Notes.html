<h1>Lesson&nbsp;01</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send out an e-mail the first week of class to let your class know that they will hit the ground running with their online class. Here is a sample e-mail you can send out the first week of class:</li>
<ul>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li>"Welcome to CIT 260! I'm excited to experience this course with you. We're going to hit the ground running this first week - Intro Week. Be sure and post your picture to the Personal Information in the "Icebreaker Discussion Board." Click&nbsp;<a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf</a> for a two-minute walkthrough on how to do this. I'll see you in the Icebreaker Discussion Board."</li>]</span></strong> 
<li>Here are a few other things you might consider including in the introduction e-mail:</li>
<ul>
<li>Information about yourself. Where you are from, your educational background, etc.</li>
<li>Reminder to purchase course textbook (students will have a reading assignment and quiz in Week 2 - the chapter will be provided to them in Week 2 if they don't have their textbook by this time; however, this is the only week where a pdf copy of the chapter is posted in the course)</li>
<li>This week, students will be able to participate in an Icebreaker discussion board. Encourage students to make their initial post earlier in the week; this will make it easier to respond to at least 4 other students' posts.</li>
<li>Inform them that they will be using several external resources in addition to I-Learn (including Git-hub, Google hangout, Net Beans, and Youtube.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>To further prepare yourself, make sure that you have access and accounts to all four external resources. Make sure that you have the textbook and make sure that you have read through the course material for this week. The more familiar you are with the course and its contents, the better prepared you are to answer student questions.</li>
<li>Also, to account for students who add the course late, the due date for the Syllabus Quiz has been moved back a week to accommodate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>During the Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may participate in the Icebreaker Discussion Board, but try not to dominate discussion.</li>
<li>Make sure students know about your office hours. Be sure to be present in Adobe Connect to visit with students during the hours you have set for yourself. Be prepared to answer student questions via e-mail, office hours, and course questions discussion board.</li>
<li>The assignment this week includes doing "Try This 1-1" and "Try This 1-2". This is the students first experience in programming Java, using the NetBeans IDE and using GitHub. You will need to monitor the students progress during the assignment and encourage them to ask questions, etc.. Students can spend a lot of time getting frustrated trying to deal with syntax issues and learning how to use the IDE. Be prepared to give them additional support as needed. You will also need to be somewhat lienent in the absolute due date because of troubles that may occur in submitting code to GITHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before the course begins you should contact Kent Jackson <a href="mailto:jacksonk@byui.edu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">jacksonk@byui.edu</a> to share the Class GitHub Repository with you.</li>
<li>Make sure all of the students create a repository in GitHub and share their repository with you. This is how you will access the student's work in order to grade it. Students will post a link to their repository when submitting their assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep up on grading; don't fall behind by more than a week</strong>. Some weeks may have a little more work for you to grade than others, so use any additional time in slower weeks to catch up on grading. You can view the course map in the Course Folder which outlines the estimated amount of time to spend on each activity.</li>
<li>Syllabus Quiz</li>
<li>Icebreaker Discussion Board</li>
<li>The grading of "Try This 1-1" and "Try This 1-2" assignments should be straight forward. I recommend giving the students 100% if the program runs successfully and a 75% if they copied the code but could not get the programs working correctly.</li>
