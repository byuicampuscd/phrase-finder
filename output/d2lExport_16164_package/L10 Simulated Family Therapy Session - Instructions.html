<h1>Simulated Family Therapy Session</h1>
<h2>Google Hangouts Activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Due by Saturday, see Calendar&nbsp;for times</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>In this activity, you will meet synchronously with a small group via <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-110697" target="_blank">Google Hangouts on Air</a>&nbsp;(HOA). After watching the video below, you will meet with your group to discuss your observations about how a skilled family therapist or paraprofessional can help to introduce or reinforce concepts and behaviors that strengthen family resiliency. Plan on meeting with your group for 1 hour (45 minutes discussing and 15 minutes debriefing). After your group meeting, you will evaluate your personal preparedness for the meeting and your contributions to the discussion and the written document produced.</p>
<h4>Part 1&mdash;Establish Your Group and Meeting Time</h4>
<p>If you have not already done so, use the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-110959" target="_blank">Selecting Group Member for HOA Activity</a>&nbsp;discussion board to find group members and establish a meeting time. Follow the instructions found on that page.</p>
<p><span> SEE INFORMATION LAST WEEK ON THE "SELECT GROUP" PAGE&nbsp;FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO ENROLL IN&nbsp;YOUR GROUP. </span></p>
<h4>Part 2&mdash;Video and Notes</h4>
<p>Watch the video below, which shows a simulated family therapy session <em>before</em> meeting as a group at your agreed upon date and time in Google Hangouts. You will also want to have a printed copy of <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-224978" target="_blank">Strengthening Family Resilience: Ch. 6</a><em>&nbsp;</em>handy (or to have it viewable on your computer screen), while you watch the video.</p>
<p><em>If you are having trouble getting the video to load, please try the following steps:</em><br /><em>1) Switch web browsers. This video seems to load best in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</em><br /><em>2) Clear your browsers cache/cookies/history and restart your computer.</em><br /><em>3) Try switching to a hardwired connection instead of a wireless connection.</em><br /><em>4) Disable any ad blocking software you have installed temporarily.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><br /><br /><em>While the transcript is helpful, there are many non verbal cues that happen within the session, so watching it is important to being able to clearly analyze the session.</em></p>
<p>In this therapy session, a family therapist demonstrates how naturally or easily one might introduce or reinforce the principles suggested by Walsh in <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-224978" target="_blank">Strengthening Family Resilience: Ch. 6</a>. This simulated session was neither scripted nor planned around the principles and practices outlined by Walsh, but it should be readily apparent how many of those are touched upon by family members and the treatment professional. As you watch, mark each of the points from the article you see touched upon in the therapy session as it takes place.</p>

<h4>Part 3&mdash;Synchronous Discussion and Collaborative Summary</h4>
<p>Meet synchronously with your group, using Google HOA. As you discuss the simulation, make sure to have access to the notes you took identifying the points from the article that related to the simulated session you saw in the video. Be prepared to share your observations with your group.</p>
<p>To make your session successful, it is recommended you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the group meeting, assign a group member to initiate the HOA session.</li>
<li>Designate a team leader to keep track of time and move the discussion along, helping to keep the group on topic and on task.</li>
<li>Designate another person to compose a brief summary of the group's overall findings, observations, and conclusions based on the post-video discussion.</li>
<li>Designate a group member to submit your summary and the Google HOA link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the following during the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take turns talking about the points you identified, both the overt references and the more subtle ones.</li>
<li>Note the trends of your findings as a group. Did everyone identify the same points, or were there points that not everyone caught?</li>
<li>Talk about your observations. Was anyone surprised by the findings or observations?</li>
<li>Discuss and record how a treatment professional or paraprofessional might prepare to capitalize on such opportunities to introduce or reinforce the types of resiliency factors from Walsh's article?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last 15 minutes of the HOA meeting, the person who was in charge of composing the summary should share it with the group to make sure that all teammates agree with the work produced and can help revise it as appropriate. This collaboration may be done by any means chosen by the group (still using Hangouts, resorting to Google Docs, exchanging emails, or whatever the group deems best). The final version of the summary should be a Word document. All participating group members' names should be on the document.</p>
<p>Once the summary is approved by the group and ready for submission, and the YouTube link to the recording is available, one group member should submit both of them. <em>Please make sure only <strong>one</strong> submission is made per group. </em>To submit, go to the next page to access "<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-110028" target="_blank">L10: Simulated Family Therapy Session</a>" and click "Upload."&nbsp;Paste the YouTube link in the comments box and attach the summary as a Word document.</p>
<h4>Part 4&mdash;Self Evaluation of Your Preparedness and Contributions</h4>
<p>After your group meeting, report your level of preparedness and contributions in the this activity using the&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16164&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-224996" target="_blank">Simulated Family Therapy Session Self-Evaluation</a>.</p>
