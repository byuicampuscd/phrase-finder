<h1>Frequently Asked Questions - Midterm Project</h1>
<br /><hr />
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The questions below are questions about by students about the Midterm project. If you have a question about the assignment, perhaps you will find the answer here. If you don't find the answer, please use the Questions and Conversations forum to ask your question so that all can learn the answer. Click on the box to display the answer from the instructor.<br /><br /></p>
<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">I have sorted out the information I wanted to use for my midterm project. However, despite this accomplishment, I have found plenty of it and find myself uncertain about how I should format it. Should I do a presentation instead of an essay? What should I do?</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">It really depends on your information and personality.&nbsp; If you like writing better than speaking, maybe an essay is the best format.&nbsp; If you would rather do minimal writing and explain your project, than a presentation is a better solution.&nbsp; If you have a lot of graphs, sometimes it is tedious and boring to write the explanation so a presentation would work better in that situation.</div>
<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">I want to focus my research on the Humanistic Theory. Basically, I am interested in learning how humanistic principles or approaches are used in education. Is this subject to broad? Should I narrow it down?</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">I've always found more narrow projects are easier to research and write. If you haven't already, just start to research the project generally and see what research topics are available. Sometimes there are studies or research into topics that are really interesting that I hadn't thought of before I started. It's pretty easy to do with Google Scholar or BYU-I Library and this will ensure that you have credible sources.</div>
<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">Do PowerPoint presentations need to have narration?&nbsp; Do you want PowerPoint presentations also uploaded to YouTube?</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">
<p>The PowerPoint presentation needs to include audio, so may will end up being a video in the end.&nbsp; You can save it as such by selecting Save As and then selecting MP4.&nbsp; Here is a good video on how to do voiceovers if you aren't familiar with the process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNAy-Gsok4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNAy-Gsok4</a>. Ignore the part at the end about how to put your video into Google Docs because you won't be doing that for this assignment.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to use Screencast-O-Matic which is a free service that allows you to do audio while recording your screen.&nbsp; Tutorials for that are located here <a href="http://help.screencast-o-matic.com/channels/cD6qq83yu#navback" target="_blank">http://help.screencast-o-matic.com/channels/cD6qq83yu#navback.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">If we are choosing to do an essay for our project, what is the required layouts for that? Meaning is it single spaced or double? APA or MLA?</div>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">It should be double spaced and in <a href="https://courses.byui.edu/AcademicSupport/writing-center/pdf/new/apa-handout.pdf" target="_blank">APA format</a>.&nbsp; This means that it will have an introduction, conclusion, references cited in the paper, and only include those sources cited in the paper in the reference page at the end.&nbsp;</div>]</span></strong> 
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">Remember, it should take 10-15 minutes to read the paper so make sure it is in depth enough to satisfy those requirements. Use images that complement and give additional information to what you are writing and PLEASE explain each of the images/graphs included.&nbsp; Don't just throw in images/graphs and expect me to guess what they mean.</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">As a Reference:&nbsp; Typically it takes approximately 2 - 2 1/2 minutes to read each double spaced page without images.</div>
<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">I am working on an essay for the midterm. Would you be available sometime this week to look it over prior to submission?</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">To be fair to all the students in the class, I can only tell you to make sure to include all of the elements.&nbsp; If you have chosen a topic listed in the List of Topics to Choose From section, covered all the criteria listed in the Required Elements section, and I can tell that you have tried to do your best, you won't need to worry about getting a low grade.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="drop-down" style="text-align: left;">I was looking over the requirements for the mid-term project and noticed it said if we do a PowerPoint that it should have speaker notes AND narration. My understanding of speaker notes is what I would be saying if I were speaking. If this is the case, I am unclear as to why we would do both and wondering if this is supposed to be speaker notes OR narration?</div>
<div class="drop-content" style="text-align: left;">Speaker notes are where you will place a bulleted list of paraphrased information and resources used for that particular slide. Do not use direct quotes!&nbsp; This information will be the backbone of that slide but won't include a word-by-word account of what will be said in your presentation. Here are some examples to illustrate.
