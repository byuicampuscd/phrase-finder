            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p>Read the <a href="jetblue.pdf" target="_blank">Jet Blue Case Study</a> and watch the <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/VideoPlayer/BYUIplayer.html?StartCue=2491&amp;EndCue=4033&amp;VideoName=122222_14&amp;VideoType=lectures" target="_blank">Jet Blue Case Video</a>]</span></strong> .
                After reviewing the case study, answer the questions listed below. Ponder the things that you have studied and answer <strong>EACH</strong> question. Make sure to clearly label your answers to the questions. (<strong>Due Tuesday, see Calendar&#xA0;for times.</strong>)</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>After writing your answers to the questions, read the answers of your classmates and respond to their posts. What do you like about their answers? In what ways do you have different ideas? To help move the discussion forward, make two <strong>additional</strong>                posts to the discussion board on three <strong>different</strong> days - SIX reply posts total. For example, if you made your initial post on Tuesday, then you would want to submit two posts on Wednesday, two posts on Thursday, etc. That
                leaves you time on Monday&#xA0;to add additional comments. (Due Monday, see Calendar for times.)</p>

                            <p>Answers to the discussion board questions are a minimum of 100 words and are thoughtful, substantive, and articulated well (not just fluff). Restating the question does not count towards your required word count. Your post

                        <td>You help move the discussion forward by participating frequently on the discussion board, by commenting on classmates&apos; posts. This means that you made at least two additional posts on three different days. Responses to classmates&apos;
                            posts are a minimum of 50 words each. Each response is substantive and articulate. Just saying, &quot;I agree&quot; is inadequate for this. Explain and provide reasons for your opinion.</td>
