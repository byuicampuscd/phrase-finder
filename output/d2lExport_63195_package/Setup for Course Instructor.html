<h1><strong>Course-Specific Setup for Instructor:</strong></h1>
<p>Send out an e-mail the first week of class to let your class know that they will hit the ground running with their online class. Here is a sample email you can send out the first week of class.</p>
<p>"Welcome to CIT 260! I'm excited to experience this course with you. We're going to hit the ground running this first week - Intro Week. Be sure and post your picture to the Personal Information in the "Icebreaker Discussion Board". Click http://<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[stream.byui.edu]</span></strong> /tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf for a 2-minute walkthrough on how to do this. I'll see you in the Icebreaker Discussion Board."</p>
<p>Please review the course schedule to familiarize yourself with how the course will work. Students may have questions this first week about setting up accounts. This course useses a variety of external resourses. Most of these resources are simple to use and students should be able to find answers to their questions online.</p>
<h2><strong>Additional Resources</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Git-hub: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a></li>
<li>Google Hangouts: <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/</a></li>
<li>Youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/</a></li>
<li>Net Beans: <a href="https://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">https://netbeans.org/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You should become familiar with each of these resources as the students may ask you some general questions. However you are NOT the technical support for the students. Students should be able to troubleshoot and find answers to their questions online. The <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=63195&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-415219" target="_blank">Accounts Setup</a>&nbsp;page in the course provides many tutorials on how to setup these resources. You will need to setup your own GitHub Account to download and grade the student work. In the Intro Week and Week 1 in order to grade assignment submissions from students, you will need to remind them to share their accounts with you.</p>
<h2><strong>Before the 1st Week of Class</strong></h2>
<p>Students will then post files to the GitHub and they will need to share their repositories with you in order for you to grade them. <strong>Make sure students do this during the intro week of the course before the assignment is due. Unless they share their repository with you, you will not be able to grade their assignments.</strong></p>
<p>You will also need to have a Gmail/Google + account in order for you to participate in any Hangouts with your students when needed. Please see the introduction week for instructions on how to <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=63195&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-372136" target="_blank">setup these accounts</a>&nbsp;for yourself.</p>
