            <h1>Preparing for Marriage Part I</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>&quot;One good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this: in her presence, do you think your noblest thoughts, do you aspire to your finest deeds, do you wish you were better than you are?&quot;</p>
            <p>-President Ezra Taft Benson</p>
            <h2>Lesson Outcomes</h2>
            <p>M. Scott Peck said, &#x201C;One result of the mysterious nature of love is that no one has ever, to my knowledge, arrived at a truly satisfactory definition of love. In an effort to explain it, therefore, love has been divided into various
                categories: eros, philia, agape; perfect love and imperfect love, and so on. I am presuming, however, to give a simgle definition of love, again with the awareness that it is likely to be in some way or ways inadequate. I define love thus:
                The will to extend one&#x2019;s self for the purpose of nurturing one&#x2019;s own or another&#x2019;s spiritual growth.&#x201D; (The Road Less Travelled, 1978, p. 81)</p>
            <p>What do you think of this definition of love? How does this compare and contrast to more commonly held definitions of love? Does this sort of love apply to the process of loving another with the hope or desire to form a lasting marital relationship?</p>
            <p>After considering different theories of family and addressing cultural and gender factors influencing family experience, we move more directly to the formation of family. We begin with how we prepare for and establish marriage relationships.
                It would be easy to gloss over these important topics, but it would be a great mistake to rely only upon your current skills and knowledge sets while making martial decisions &#x201C;Marriage is perhaps the most vital of all the decisions
                and has the most far-reaching effects, for it has to do not only with immediate happiness, but eternal joy as well. It affects not only the two people involved, but their families and particularly their children and their children&#x2019;s
                children down through the many generations.&#x201D; (Spencer W. Kimball, 1976, Marriage and Divorce, 2)</p>

                <li>Discuss and understand predictors of marital success, beginning with mate selection strategies.</li>
                <li>Recognize the differences between formal dating and more current models of mate selection.</li>
                <li>Create a marriage preparation plan, drawing upon the principles addressed this week.</li>

                    divorce rates and establishing causation. Can you catch them?)</li>
