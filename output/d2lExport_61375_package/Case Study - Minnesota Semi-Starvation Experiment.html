<p><img alt="Minnesota starvation experiment" class="left" src="Minnesota_starvationimage.jpg" title="Minnesota starvation experiment" width="29%" />In the United States and many other developed countries, excessive weight gain is a major health concern. It is common for people to try to lower their weight by going on very low calorie diets to get quick results. Have you ever wondered what happens to the body, both physically and psychologically, when it is deprived of food for an extended time?</p>
<p>During the last year of World War II, Ancel Keys conducted a study in human starvation to determine how to best feed people after the war. Thirty-six conscientious objectors to war participated in the study. One of the participants, Jim Greene, gave a 22-minute interview of what happened during the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>What happened to the eating behaviors of the participant who "cheated and had ice cream?</li>
<li>What happened during the night after the participants got a "relief" meal which was higher in calories and protein?</li>
<li>What was the impact of adding in extra vitamins and protein during the re-feeding phase?</li>
<li>What was the impact of the semi-starvation on the level of hunger the men experienced after the experiment? What implication may this have for people who follow very-low-calorie diets?</li>
</ul>
