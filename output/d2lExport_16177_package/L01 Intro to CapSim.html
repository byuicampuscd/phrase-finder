            <h1>L01: Intro to CapSim</h1>
            <p><strong>Due&#xA0;Monday of Week 2, see Calendar for times</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>An integral part of this class is a simulated business called CapSim. You will go through three separate CapSim simulations, Rehearsal Rounds, Practice Rounds, and the Competition Rounds.You will complete rehearsal rounds as an individual
                in the getting started section. You will then complete practice rounds individually and with other classmates. Being on a team with other students will not start until lesson 4 in the semester.</p>
            <p>Your grade on the simulation is based on the performance of your company, i.e. how well your team &quot;manages&quot; your company. In the simulation, you will make a series of business decisions that will be judged in a simulated competitive
                market. As in the real market, some sets of decisions are more successful than others. While there is an element of competition, you can do well with respect to your grade if you make a valiant effort and prove you have learned from the
                mistakes made in the simulation.</p>
            <p>20% of your overall grade in the course is based on the CapSim simulation. The grading structure for the simulation is based on a balanced scorecard. Your simulation grade will also included points based on team member feedback.</p>
            <p>Thoroughly read the information below and watch the videos as an introduction to CapSim by Saturday.</p>
            <p>CapSim can be difficult at first but with hard work you can master this simulation. Listen to what other students have to say about CapSim.</p>
            <p>Note: There is a Capsim lab held Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings from 5:15PM - 7:15PM MDT. If you are in Rexburg the lab is held in Smith 220. If you not in Rexburg, there is an online lab. Your instructor will email the online meeting
                url for that semester.</p>

            <p>At the end of the business simulation in week 13, you will be asked to prepare a presentation to shareholders in which you will &quot;sell&quot; yourselves to a group of fictional shareholders in an attempt to receive more funding for future
                investments. Click on the links below to view past students presentations to shareholders.<em>Note: These are just examples of groups that went above and beyond the requirements for an on-campus class.</em>&#xA0;A movie production like
                these examples is not expected for this class. From these videos, you can get an idea of how they use data to sell themselves and their work to the shareholder group.</p>
