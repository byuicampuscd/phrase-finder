<p>KING: Rumor has it that Brother King&rsquo;s teaching and everyone must be like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be here to listen to this guy.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s probably a few of you, right, because this is required? So I&rsquo;m going to pass these around a little bit and I pre-signed them, but I forgot my stamp. The last time I taught they made a mess of my stamp, so maybe it&rsquo;s good that I forgot it. If you guys want to go to one of the study rooms and get some of those rolling chairs&mdash;or you&rsquo;re welcome to stand. They say that the cap in this room is 40, and it makes no sense whatsoever, but yeah, go grab a chair and come on over. I grabbed a couple of chairs, but my generosity only goes so far.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kay, so I know we&rsquo;ve got a handful of accounting students in here. Some of you poor souls, I hear that you have the exact same workshop, is that true? I don&rsquo;t know. I think a few people in the last workshop were confused because they were like, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve done the exact same thing a couple of semesters ago,&rdquo; which is weird, right? Whatever. And I know we have some Comm majors, we have some family history studies, what else do we got? We&rsquo;ve got science, university studies, anything else I&rsquo;m missing? Biology? Education students? I don&rsquo;t know. I have a list, I&rsquo;m just curious, I just wanted to get to know my audience. But yeah, it looks like a good group.</p>
<p>So one thing I&rsquo;ll ask is, if you can, some participation would be nice. If you want. Oh! That reminds me. So I&rsquo;ve got these packets&mdash;you guys were asked to print these off, right? Nobody did? Okay, well, I&rsquo;ve printed out some, but there may not be enough. Take one, pass it on, because I do want you to read the packet, so it will be helpful if you have it. Before we kick off, though, maybe we can start off with a word of prayer? I don&rsquo;t know if you usually start workshops off with a word of prayer, but whatever. Who would like to offer the opening prayer? Any takers? Okay, yes, thank you.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Heavenly Father, at the opening of this workshop and prayer, we give you gratitude for this opportunity to learn at this campus, and be able to learn. We&rsquo;re grateful, Father, and that the things that are taught will be able to apply them and be able to take them to heart, and be able to use them every day when searching for jobs. Father, we&rsquo;re grateful for this brother, who has prepared for this class meeting, and let your spirit be upon him. We thank thee so very much for all the blessings. We say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
<p>STUDENTS: Amen.</p>
<p>BROTHER: &lsquo;Kay, guys, come on in. There may not be seats for you, but you can go grab one out of those studies rooms or just hang out in the back, whatever works for you. So again, my name is Vance King. I am a career and academic advisor here at BYU&ndash;Idaho, specifically for Education and Human Development. So psych majors, sociology, family. I advise students in those majors specifically. Got my bachelor&rsquo;s in social work right here at BYU&ndash;Idaho, realized that there was absolutely no money in that, so I got my master&rsquo;s in academic administration, no money in that either. Wherever you want, you can pull up a chair wherever. Sit on somebody&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>So yeah, I taught this yesterday, and it was recorded yesterday, so everyone was a little on edge. But tonight it&rsquo;s not recorded, so relax, so it won&rsquo;t be broadcasted anywhere else. Again, I appreciate your comments. At the same time, I know that just because we have an hour, if you&rsquo;re dying to make a comment and I&rsquo;m just speeding along and I ignore your hand, don&rsquo;t take offense. I&rsquo;m just realizing that I have to rush, nothing personal. So that&rsquo;s me, and that&rsquo;s how this workshop is going to go. So about halfway through, they were very&mdash;Oh, where did that go? About halfway through, I&rsquo;ll start passing the slips around. The people who do this workshop have teachers that said you have to at least be here 50 minutes to get this signed off on, so I&rsquo;ll pass these around about halfway through. So if you walk out after that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Any ways, writing resumes and cover letters. Hopefully we all have a good idea on how to do this. Just as a kick off, can I get somebody to read on the packets that I&rsquo;m handing out or they printed off? Can someone read the quote from President Hinckley on there? Right here.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Be faithful, be true, go forward, be ambitious. Don&rsquo;t short-circuit yourself, don&rsquo;t stop now. Keep going. Keep going. Educate your minds and your spirits, and never lose sight of the fact that you are a child of God with a divine destiny and capability of doing great and good and wonderful things. Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short.</p>
<p>KING: &lsquo;Kay, so I&rsquo;m going to make a statement here. I submit to you that if you&rsquo;re not learning how to do things like this, learning how to write well, learning how to make resume and cover letters, learning how to network, you&rsquo;re selling yourself short at BYU&ndash;Idaho. And you&rsquo;re going to feel the impact when you try to go out and look for a job, and you&rsquo;re not performing as well as your peers. Those people who learned how to write an effective resume, how to interview right, they&rsquo;re going to be ahead of you, even if your GPA is higher. Even if all your teachers loved you. You&rsquo;re still going to be a little bit behind. And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here, just hope that you continue to go to these workshops like this, get your resume reviewed, talk to professionals, network. Learn how to market yourself and say hey. It will make a big difference, I promise.</p>
<p>Okay, so I didn&rsquo;t make this slideshow, so if you&rsquo;re wondering and thinking that this is kind of crummy, I didn&rsquo;t make it. But if you think this is awesome, I signed off on it. This part is going to get a little weird as I go on about these things, but it&rsquo;s kind of just a key. It&rsquo;s important to know that resumes are marketing tools, not a biography. What does that mean? Does anybody have a thought on that? Yeah.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Kind of sell yourself?</p>
<p>KING: Yeah, the key word is marketing, right? They don&rsquo;t want to just hear about your past, this isn&rsquo;t a journal of your work-related stuff. They want, you need to market yourself. Your resume is an advertising tool, this is what I&rsquo;ve done. Focus on goals and accomplishments rather than just duties. One way that we can market ourselves is to sell ourselves in the best possible way, and just putting what we were assigned to do doesn&rsquo;t show employers much potential, y&rsquo;know, this is what I nailed, this is what I did well. There&rsquo;s this little part, add on to the company saying not what they can do for you, but&hellip;</p>
<p>STUDENTS: What you can do for them.</p>
<p>KING: Did anyone watch the debate tonight? Okay. Yeah, politics. So there&rsquo;s a need to show actual numbers, visible stuff that they can say, &ldquo;Whoa, this person has done this.&rdquo; Use key words, which we are going to get into later. Getting noticed, in a good way, right? You don&rsquo;t want to be like, &ldquo;Whoa, I&rsquo;ll never forget this resume, that was horrible.&rdquo; And then this, I don&rsquo;t know what this last one is. It&rsquo;s in quotes, like someone had said it: &ldquo;I want them to be able to tell their story through their resume&hellip;&rdquo; Yeah, just ponder upon that and write it down. Give that some thought. We&rsquo;ll skip that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kay, but I do want to look at these 6 P&rsquo;s. So if you have a packet, flip to the second page and let&rsquo;s go through this.</p>
<p>[The slide reads:</p>
<p>The 6 P&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Perfect: no mistakes, positioning: put &ldquo;wow&rdquo; items up top, painless: quick and easy to read, page: not too long, paper: get it noticed, position: show you are a good fit.] Can someone read these, in the packet in the first piece, and read its accompanying bullet points as well. Anyone want to volunteer for that?</p>
<p>Student: Make sure it&rsquo;s perfect, that everything is spelled correctly and grammar. Have several people proofread through it, especially those you professional trust.</p>
<p>KING: &lsquo;Kay, so why do we have so many people proofread our r&eacute;sum&eacute;? Yeah.</p>
<p>Student: To get different opinions.</p>
<p>KING: Excellent, yeah. So when they&rsquo;re proofreading, I don&rsquo;t know, some people have this&hellip; Man, they can catch grammar things, right, and I don&rsquo;t know. But you get multiple people looking at it and getting feedback. Have you ever done this, where you&rsquo;ve sent an email out and you want it to look good and you look over it a couple of times and you send it out. You get a response from whoever you emailed; you happen to glance at your opening email and there&rsquo;s like this blatant grammatical error. You spelled something like &ldquo;the&rdquo; wrong. How did that happen, how did I not see that? Getting people to look at it will help with some of those problems. Obviously you&rsquo;re not going to bring over all of your emails and be like, &ldquo;Hey, look at these.&rdquo; But with your resume, it&rsquo;s got to be perfect. It can be perfect and there&rsquo;s really no excuse for it not to be. It should be free from errors like that. So getting people to look over it is a good way to catch that. And then when you&rsquo;re looking at content as well, it can see how we&rsquo;re doing, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Another tip there is when you&rsquo;re looking over your resume, take a break, don&rsquo;t just keep looking at it. Take a break. Don&rsquo;t work on it all day and send it out to your potential employer. Leave it for a day or two, maybe even longer, and come back to it. You&rsquo;d be surprised what you&rsquo;ll see with fresh eyes. Anyways, just some food for thought right there. Any other thoughts on that? One thing I do want to make clear too is resume writing is kind of subject. So if other people have other opinions and someone says, &ldquo;Hey, this is something I&rsquo;ve been doing and it&rsquo;s helped&rdquo; and throws it in, and the other kid looks like they&rsquo;re struggling. And I hope as they&rsquo;re putting down their notes, you&rsquo;re writing down notes as well, because I think we all have good ideas on how to write resumes. Can I get someone to read the second piece?</p>
<p>Student: Positioning. Most important information should go up top to the left. Your resume is a marketing tool, everything you say must be true. You must be prepared to show it in an interview, it need not be comprehensive, but what relates to the job.</p>
<p>KING: Okay, I just mentioned that resumes can be subjective, right? This is something I firmly believe in when writing resumes. When I write my resume&hellip; Well, here&rsquo;s an example. While I was at BYU, I was a grad student, I worked at a Brick Oven pizza place over there. I wasn&rsquo;t even a server, I was a bus boy. It was like me and a bunch of high school kids and it was a lot of fun, but&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t even put down server, I mean, &ldquo;bus boy.&rdquo; And sometimes I hear people say, y&rsquo;know, you want to put it in chronological order, the most recent job should be at the top. No way, there was no way I was going to put down that I was a bus boy. I had better experience, but I was in grad school, so that was all I could get, so that&rsquo;s what I was doing. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to put that first. So I won&rsquo;t do that. What I do, typically&hellip; For example, I got my degree in social networking, right? I worked as a social worker for a couple of years going into grad school, I had some clients that I worked with off and on with during school. So social work, let&rsquo;s say I want to get some work now and get out of the university game. Here&rsquo;s my resume, don&rsquo;t look close. Don&rsquo;t read it, you&rsquo;re gonna be like, &ldquo;How is this guy working?&rdquo; This is an older resume, it&rsquo;s not great. So I&rsquo;m current academic counselor, there&rsquo;s old academic advising, stuff like that. If I was going to apply for a social work job, there&rsquo;s no way I would leave this social work at the bottom. Like, okay, that was back in &rsquo;06-&rsquo;08, but if I&rsquo;m applying for a social work job, I&rsquo;m putting that at top, always. I&rsquo;ll still put the years, I&rsquo;m not going to lie about the years, so I&rsquo;ll put that over there. But I&rsquo;m letting them know this is what I&rsquo;ve done, this is what pertains to you. Again, other people may disagree, but that&rsquo;s my theory. So there&rsquo;s that. Take that for what it&rsquo;s worth. You don&rsquo;t have to believe everything that I say.</p>
<p>Student: So would you put it in chronological order after that, or&hellip;</p>
<p>KING: For me, I&rsquo;m putting everything that is most relevant, back to back to back. And I&rsquo;m leaving the bus boy off! I don&rsquo;t want them to know I was a bus boy. Unless I was going for a surfer job, I don&rsquo;t know. Yeah?</p>
<p>Student: That&rsquo;s like a functional resume, right?</p>
<p>KING: Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t get too much into the is it a space resume or functional, I&rsquo;m putting my resume together in what is going to be the most important to my employer. So we&rsquo;ll get into this a little bit later, but you&rsquo;ll have your standard resume, and every time you apply for a job that baby is going to change. You&rsquo;re just going to change it up and tailor it to your employer. Okay, can I get someone to read that third piece?</p>
<p>Student: Painless: easy and quick to read. It should be 10 point font, your professional heading should be larger and usually bold, 12-14 point font. Margins should be used between .5 and 1 inches, all tabs should line up immediately.</p>
<p>KING: &lsquo;Kay, pretty standard stuff. No font so small that they&rsquo;re squinting, right, or not so big that they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Well this is taking up the whole screen.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like writing a paper right before class, just filling up. One thing that I&rsquo;ll add onto that is a PDF copy. I&rsquo;ve had some student that will email me their resume, and they&rsquo;re really not think because they put it in the email. That thing always looks junky once it gets to me. My computer sees things differently, and oh man, they can&rsquo;t even format it correctly. Even when they send Word documents, it just looks funky. Like my Word is different than theirs. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re young and cool, on things like a Mac and I&rsquo;m that not as cool guy&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m another guy, not as cool as Apple. But yeah, PDF, send it in a PDF because PDFs don&rsquo;t change. It looks like it&rsquo;s not tampered, like you can send it as a PDF and you know it&rsquo;s going to look like it&rsquo;s supposed to look. So hopefully we know that. Can I get somebody to read the page bullet point?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Page: not too long. For an undergraduate, one page is appropriate. Be sure to fill the entire page.</p>
<p>KING: In creating a resume in this time of your life, if you have trouble getting to a page, set up an appointment with our career counselors or our people assigned to work on resumes. They&rsquo;ll help you brainstorm a bit, help you come up with enough to fill a page. If you&rsquo;ve got like a page and you have that extra stuff, get that thing down to a page. Get rid of the hobbies. I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re a fly fisherman. So just make sure that it&rsquo;s an even page. Later on in life when you get more experience, it may get bigger, and that&rsquo;s okay, as long as you&rsquo;re filling out pages. Then again, it will vary from job to job. But everything I say I can then just say, &ldquo;but is varies!&rdquo; So everything about the page, pretty obvious. How about paper, can we get somebody to read that?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Paper: get it noticed. Your resume should be on nice resume paper, 24 pounds. Have it on 20 pound paper. If handing your resume to a prospective employer, do not fold it, use a large envelope.</p>
<p>KING: &lsquo;Kay, when I first looked at this worksheet, I thought, 24 pounds? You all know what that is, right? So it&rsquo;s like paper that can come in 20 pounds, and it&rsquo;s really thin. So the point of that parentheses, the 24 pounds, is for nicer paper. And yeah, don&rsquo;t fold it or do other stuff to it. Some more obvious stuff, right? Can I get someone to read the next one? The position? Any takers?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Position: show you are a good fit. Do your best to acquire skills for your desired position. Use words in the job description to describe yourself.</p>
<p>KING: And we&rsquo;ll actually get there, we&rsquo;ll hold off on that for now. I&rsquo;m going to start handing them out now. If you hand in something with that big of font, I&rsquo;m just going to slip it back and say get out of here! So resume outline, I want to go over this a little bit too. Obviously I think we all know the standard outline, right? None of you are putting your name down at the bottom. We&rsquo;d have to backtrack and talk. So name and address at the top. The only thing I want to touch on there is large, bold and stand out. You know that. If you&rsquo;re doing a crazy font with your name, stop it. Don&rsquo;t use, like, the really cursive font or whatever. Don&rsquo;t use really small font or annoying fonts, whatever. Make sure your address and email is professionally appropriate, then in parenthesis it says like gmail. Like gmail is really that professional. But what it means is, like with gmail, don&rsquo;t put down soccer4life. Soccer was your life in high school. Don&rsquo;t put down soccer4life@gmail. Like coolshoot&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, just don&rsquo;t do it. And then another reason they put down gmail is because if the byui email is too, y&rsquo;know, <a href="mailto:meg0101203@byui.edu">meg0101203@byui.edu</a>. Not real memorable, kind of weird. So as you&rsquo;re preparing a resume and getting that stuff out there, maybe it&rsquo;s time to create a special email address that has your first and last name. So I&rsquo;m <a href="mailto:MichaelKing@gmail.com">MichaelKing@gmail.com</a>. It&rsquo;s easy, right? So just be considering that when&hellip; I had some students at my last workshop say that the hip new thing is to leave your address off and leave a LinkedIn account, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe not. Including a LinkedIn account, that&rsquo;s fine, but you want to leave your address on there, you want them to be able to find you. Be sure when you&rsquo;re updating your resume too, it&rsquo;s easy to forgot that address. So I&rsquo;ve done that, where I&rsquo;ve sent it out and I was still like living in Utah. Some information there. So objective or profile. Can I get someone to read the bullets about objective and profile? We&rsquo;ll talk about that shortly, thanks.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Objective and profiles are often old, but they can be a strong element in your resume. Alter the objective when you know the industry company or job that you are applying for. Where these are not considered as relevant, opt for a profile when you would like to highlight your skills. Objectives and profiles should be specific.</p>
<p>KING: &lsquo;Kay, so I&rsquo;ve got an example here, this is this person&rsquo;s objective looking for a customer manager position applying for a service position. So the objective: to get a challenging job in a customer managers so that I can learn more and excel in my career. What do you guys think? Good or bad? Horrible! Right? To get a challenging job in a customer service manager so that <em>I</em> can learn more and excel in <em>my</em> career. They don&rsquo;t care, they want to know what you can do for them. So be sure if you&rsquo;re writing an objective or a statement, don&rsquo;t make it all about&hellip; It&rsquo;s weird, because your objective really is maybe that, right? They want to know how you&rsquo;ll help them. If we were all writing honest objectives, we&rsquo;d all be like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m applying for this job because my current job makes $60,000 and I want to make 70.&rdquo; Y&rsquo;know, don&rsquo;t do it about you. You tell them how you can help them. So a couple of examples that we&rsquo;ll look at. So we&rsquo;re going to take a weird step back and, well, here&rsquo;s this one. This is a little bit of a different angle. &ldquo;I am looking for a position in management when I graduate.&rdquo; Kind of weak, so they have this other example: &ldquo;A challenging entry-level management position utilizing my skills and knowledge in management, human resources and general business practices.&rdquo; Alright, a little bit more wordy, a little bit more businesss-y, but better. &lsquo;Kay, let&rsquo;s look over here at some of these resumes. So I want your honest opinion on these resumes. I didn&rsquo;t write them. I don&rsquo;t care if you hate them. Melyssa Winn. I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s a real person. But let&rsquo;s talk about it anyways. What do you guys think, do you like it? You don&rsquo;t like it? Why don&rsquo;t you like it?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Too artsy, too colorful. I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>STUDENT 2: You don&rsquo;t like it? I like a little green&mdash;I&rsquo;m color-blind, so it comes out kind of cool.</p>
<p>KING: I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not going to work out for everybody, y&rsquo;know, if you&rsquo;re applying to a formal business, you should avoid color. But I don&rsquo;t know, it doesn&rsquo;t drive me crazy. I think it makes the name pop. What else do you like or dislike?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Well, I&rsquo;m graduating, so I&rsquo;ve been interviewing at places, and a lot of&hellip; I just did a business resume and they said &ldquo;I want to see a creative resume. If you&rsquo;re going to work in the communication field, I want to see your creativity, so do something fun.&rdquo; And they were showing me some examples, and some of them are just like&hellip; One of them was a QR code where you put your smartphone down and the smartphone goes to the resume up on the page, it&rsquo;s really cool. It&rsquo;s just way out there, so I guess it all depends. So if she&rsquo;s going for a Comm, that&rsquo;s awesome. If she&rsquo;s going for business, yeah, maybe not the greatest.</p>
<p>KING: I don&rsquo;t think it looks the greatest, but fairly well done. But this is not going to work for every place. And this is another good reason, like he&rsquo;s been visiting with actual players, and they told you what they want? That&rsquo;s awesome. You get an idea of what people want. That&rsquo;s another great reason to have other people look at it, and have people look at it that are in that field. I think if you&rsquo;re starting with an opening statement, have a professional that you trust do it. Maybe a better way to spell that out is a professional you trust that works in that field that you are applying to. What else about this resume? Let&rsquo;s scroll down a bit. Does everything look cool? Do you have any questions, because I&rsquo;m just curious. I noticed that&mdash;okay, so over there, on the dates, like the Washington, D.C.? You go down and it looks like Rexburg, Idaho doesn&rsquo;t match up. No big deal, I&rsquo;d still hire them.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Is there an objective?</p>
<p>KING: I don&rsquo;t think there is on this one. And sometimes, as I&rsquo;ve been doing my research, objectives and profile statements, again, you&rsquo;re going to want to look at the major, look at the job you&rsquo;re going into to see if those are necessary. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re always necessary. I kind of like them if they&rsquo;re down right. Open up and they just read that quick objective, or maybe it&rsquo;s a bit more lengthy but they did a good job. Good way to sell yourself right off of the bat. Just some other thoughts with resumes, we&rsquo;re gonna kinda go into, let&rsquo;s go ahead and touch on that now. I like what she&rsquo;s done in terms of formatting, so she&rsquo;s got the education in caps. I like how after that she&rsquo;s got her actual degree listed and bolded, so that stands out. I&rsquo;ve seen some students put what they&rsquo;ve done before the title. I promise you that the majority of employers are more interested in what you did rather than what your title was and where you got it. I&rsquo;ve seen several students bring the date over here, to be seen first. I&rsquo;m sure that most of you aren&rsquo;t doing that, but we don&rsquo;t care about those. Get them away. If they&rsquo;re over here, y&rsquo;know, that&rsquo;s fine. But everything that is important should be over here, let&rsquo;s start where their eyes are going to go. And in America, we read left to right. Yeah?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Something I noticed, the GPA for education? Does that depend on your major? For like an accounting major, like me, it&rsquo;s make-it or break-it when getting the top.</p>
<p>STUDENT 2: Yeah, so maybe she&rsquo;s rocking a 2.9, she&rsquo;d leave that thing off, right?</p>
<p>KING: If a student put that on, no matter what, you don&rsquo;t need to. And maybe for accounting, that&rsquo;s such a vital component that they want that on there. For a lot of general majors and general resumes, though, if it&rsquo;s not a 3.8 or 3.9, think about leaving that off. They&rsquo;re going to look at that and say, &ldquo;oh, 3.0. This is a student average, and we don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; Sorry, I got all in a fist about that. We know that GPA isn&rsquo;t about that, we know to put your best foot forward. So if your GPA is not your strong suit, I&rsquo;d say leave it off unless it&rsquo;s required. So I like that she left it off, it&rsquo;s a good example. Good eye, I like that. So let&rsquo;s just scroll down a bit here. How do you feel about her bullets? Her descriptions of her deeds, her achievements. I think that they&rsquo;re well written. Y&rsquo;know, I haven&rsquo;t pored over them too much, but I like them, I like how she has some numbers here. Y&rsquo;know, showing that you&rsquo;ve held an annual attendance&mdash;y&rsquo;know, if she had just left that at annual event, that&rsquo;s not near as impressive as 20,000. So get those numbers on there, that&rsquo;s huge. I do feel like that bullet seems long, I mean it carries on into another sentence. Again, some of these things aren&rsquo;t deal breakers, but it&rsquo;s just good to consider when you&rsquo;re making your resume. &lsquo;kay. Recruited over 300 speakers leading invitation letters. 300, that&rsquo;s a good number. If you&rsquo;ve got 2, just put down just 2. Just leave that off, sell yourself. Yeah?</p>
<p>STUDENT: What&rsquo;s the average time that a person will look at a resume? You talked about the bullet point being too long, is there times when it is too long?</p>
<p>KING: Correct. So I have an office where I hire student advisers. I maybe look at 20 resumes in two days, and I don&rsquo;t read them all the way through. I&rsquo;ll look at them, I hate to say it, sometimes if I&rsquo;m just totally turned off by what I see initially, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll read that thing fully. I&rsquo;ll probably look at it again and again and maybe glance at it. But at these bigger businesses, when they&rsquo;re going through resumes, they&rsquo;re taking quick glances. So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got to have it all over here. The shorter the better so it&rsquo;s more readable, not like a novel. Yeah?</p>
<p>STUDENT: Is that why you leave the summary off? Because they could care less why you want the job and they just want to know that you&rsquo;re qualified for the job. So if they&rsquo;re reading your resume, it&rsquo;s taking time away from them and looking at your qualifications?</p>
<p>KING: Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point. Let me show you&hellip; Man, it&rsquo;s like showing you my journal. Let me show you my resume. I don&rsquo;t want you to laugh at it. Let me show you my resume. Now it&rsquo;s far from perfect, right, but I did add an opening statement to mine. &lsquo;Kay, it&rsquo;s not great, but group facilitator in a group and served as a student advisor with three years&rsquo; group student service experience. I&rsquo;m applying for a student service job, right off the bat I say&mdash;I looked at their job description, they wanted at least two years. I know I&rsquo;ve got them nailed there, they&rsquo;ll think that&rsquo;s pretty impressive, right? Student management education involvement including yada, yada, yada. 2 years and over 100 internship hours experience working with youth. I know that they want that, so I&rsquo;m hitting on those. Dependable and reliable, and this is for an online ad, so I know that they&rsquo;re worried about stable and reliable, they&rsquo;re worried about turnover. So I put that on there. So I guess I show you that by saying that sometimes I find that it can be helpful. Maybe you looked at that and thought, &ldquo;Not for me, man.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s fine. Let me show you another resume that&rsquo;s not mine so I can relax. Let&rsquo;s see what you think of this one. So this next one is going to look really different, this is for an education student. Do we have any education students here? Sweet. This is for early childhood education. Their formatting is s a bit different, alright? If everything&rsquo;s in the middle? That&rsquo;s all good for them. Here&rsquo;s her summary statement: Conscientious early childhood educator, improvement facilitator while learning successful learning relationships with preschoolers. Not bad. I mean, it&rsquo;s not a real sentence because there isn&rsquo;t a period at the end? I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel about that. See anything you like? Anything you dislike? This education stuff down here, maybe that&rsquo;s how they do it, but they do need to space their specifications. Oh yes, please?</p>
<p>STUDENT: I was going to say, like, I like how yours had numbers and had factual figures. Like this one, anyone can put this down as they are an educator of early childhood, but you have the figures that show work. I think those numbers really help.</p>
<p>KING: And that other resume had numbers too, it was really awesome, right?</p>
<p>STUDENT: I guess the biggest thing that I thought was you can tell she used a template because she didn&rsquo;t finish doing everything.</p>
<p>KING: Yeah. So I feel like the margins are far out. I feel like this is the money stuff right here and she&rsquo;s putting things a little far out. Again, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re nitpicking, but that&rsquo;s what resumes are all about. One student in my last class said she liked the name. I agree, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool name. You poor people that have been named John Smith. It doesn&rsquo;t jump out as much as a Miya Stucki. I&rsquo;ve seen some resumes where I&rsquo;ve thought, &ldquo;Oh, cool name,&rdquo; and oddly I spend more time with them. So change your name. I thought I saw another hand, maybe not. So anyways, back to the example, showing you this different type, it shows that there is variation a bit, depending on what you&rsquo;re going into. This isn&rsquo;t the best example, but it shows you a little bit of a different formatting angle that is somewhat acceptable for the job that student is looking for. Okay, this one. Now I told you I didn&rsquo;t prepare this PowerPoint, this presentation. I&rsquo;ve prepared others, but I didn&rsquo;t prepare this one. And there&rsquo;s just this random slide of this resume, and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what they wanted you to glean from it. Let&rsquo;s zoom in a little bit, this one is weird. I kind of like it. I don&rsquo;t know, what do you think? A renaissance woman&mdash;it&rsquo;s in quotes! A &ldquo;renaissance woman who believes that facing any situation with integrity, determination and consideration is important to every success&mdash;in any endeavor.&rdquo; I feel like the name is a little small. One student said it&rsquo;s hard, you don&rsquo;t know where to look or put my eyes. And I think that&rsquo;s true, and that&rsquo;s a problem. What do you guys see here? What do you like, what do you dislike? You&rsquo;ve got your BYU-I email, and that&rsquo;s trouble, right? But I like that little blip, right? This girl seems artsy. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s good, but I like it.</p>
<p>STUDENT: If you zoom down, we&rsquo;ve got a whole view of the entire resume and it just looks cluttered. It just looks like there&rsquo;s a ton of stuff going on.</p>
<p>KING: What else? Is there anything else you dislike?</p>
<p>STUDENT 2: Well I do like the little relevance notes, it&rsquo;s really easy to tell what she&rsquo;s good at.</p>
<p>KING: Yeah, and again, I apologize, with this example I don&rsquo;t know exactly what she&rsquo;s going for, but if these relevant skills are really relevant, that&rsquo;s kind of a cool way to do it. Again, it&rsquo;s not really traditional. I do want to know what she&rsquo;s applying for. She&rsquo;s got these words over here, like Women&rsquo;s choir, scholarship recipient, outstanding foreign language, it&rsquo;s more women&rsquo;s choir, treble choir. I don&rsquo;t know. If she&rsquo;s not applying for choir, then why is that so high up on the page? Typically we&rsquo;re putting that kind of stuff in when we&rsquo;re dying for a full page, right? We&rsquo;ll throw in our skills at the bottom. So maybe not the best example. But okay, she&rsquo;s got her GPA on there, 3.93? Like it? Yeah, it&rsquo;s a pretty good GPA. A minor is Spanish, she&rsquo;s got her minor there. She put her school up top in bold, not a fan of that. I know BYU-Idaho is impressive, but let&rsquo;s put what you&rsquo;ve done. But again, just some things to consider. So job descriptions and accomplishments. So you&rsquo;ve all heard to lead with action verbs. If you flip over to page four, a bunch of action verbs for you to look at. Are they verbs, adverbs, I don&rsquo;t know. Words. Look those over, those might be helpful to you. Spend a lot of time preparing your statements. Flip over to page four, I want to show you examples. Before we get into those examples, let me show you this one. How do I feel about this one? Well I know what&rsquo;s wrong with this one, but&hellip; &ldquo;My duties included helping customers and closing.&rdquo; So that doesn&rsquo;t really tell much about who you are or how you sell yourself. For all we know, you could be slacking off. So these are the better explanations and these are intense. &ldquo;Upheld facility standards to guarantee order and cleanliness which provided customers with an exceptional dining experience.&rdquo; Very nice. &ldquo;Developed and implemented a customer satisfaction survey, assessed climate and offered suggestions to enhance service.&rdquo; Pretty sharp. I thought it would be funny if the job was at, like, McDonald&rsquo;s with those awesome bullets. I may just hire him because this kid&rsquo;s creative. He made something pretty mundane sound awesome. But do you think this could be true for a McDonald&rsquo;s employee, this top bullet? Yeah. He made it awesome. Or she, whatever. The person who made it up. Okay, let&rsquo;s look at page four, we&rsquo;ve got a few of these. Cash or sales, if you look at that top bullet. Selected to cashier, under their job, what they succeeded at, what was their skill. Selected to man the cashier lane because of speed and accuracy. Good, right? Yeah, I mean, whoever this was was good enough to work the express lane. That sounds cool. &lsquo;Kay, look at this fourth one, this one kills me. Actively promoted the store&rsquo;s donation drive; helped the store raise $125,000 during a three-month campaign. I know that this is the kid at Walmart when you&rsquo;re checking out, &ldquo;Do you want to donate a dollar to children hospital, whatever it is&rdquo;? What are they called? Primary children hospital. That&rsquo;s probably all he did. But tell me if this is a lie? He actively promoted, meaning he asked every customer that went by, he asked them that question because he has to. He actively promoted the store&rsquo;s donation drive to help the store raise $125,000. True, right, he helped. He got those dollars one by one by one. Did anyone not sign this? He raised $125,000 in a three month campaign. This kid just made himself sound awesome! And you guys all have experiences like that in your jobs. We just don&rsquo;t take enough time to come up with statements like these, statements that are awesome. One thing I wish I had done in my past jobs is as I&rsquo;m working, I&rsquo;d be thinking of my resume and be jotting things down as I&rsquo;m going so I can remember that stuff. So pretty awesome example. But I think I&rsquo;d hire that kid right off the bat. The bottom one, the last one regarding cash and sales: is regarded as one of the fastest cashiers and can accurately clear orders. This is one I point out to you because they may call you on this. They may contact an employer and say, &ldquo;So, I heard that so-and-so was a cashier for you, how did that go?&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;re lying, they&rsquo;re going to be like, &ldquo;This guy was slow, y&rsquo;know,&rdquo; and that will get you out of it quick. Yeah.</p>
<p>STUDENT: Looking at those, in the first bullet point, they mention fast twice.</p>
<p>KING: That is true. And I don&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s another thing to point out. How many bullet points? 10 is too many. If this were an actual job resume, that&rsquo;s a ton of bullets for a cashier job. So typically you want how many bullets per job description, per job? Four? At the very least, three? Maybe five? I&rsquo;m asking. And typically the job that is on top is either the most relevant or most recently. Give that one the most bullet points. The job after that has maybe one less and as it goes down to your later experiences, the ones that are less relevant, they should have less bullets. We don&rsquo;t want you having a cool job up here with just two or three bullets and then down at the bottom you have this monster post of junk. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense visually, it&rsquo;s just not going to help them. Putting our most relevant stuff on top is to talk about our most relevant stuff. But yeah, great point. That&rsquo;s another good point. Don&rsquo;t say the same thing twice. So there&rsquo;s&hellip; You just don&rsquo;t have time for that. You&rsquo;ve got to sell yourself quickly. Let&rsquo;s look down there at the server because of my bus boy experience, I&rsquo;m attached to this one. Yeah? Oh! So that next bullet under server. Trained servers in etiquette. Pretty good, and you&rsquo;ve probably done stuff like that, you just don&rsquo;t know it. That fourth one, using multitasking abilities to frequently check sections of the restaurant during peak hours. Again, if that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s a good one for that job. And then this general one, that very top one, demonstrated responsibilities for working with no direct oversight. Trusted by supervisors. Pretty good.</p>
<p>I worked as a student here, I did the four am custodial shift. I could have put that on my resume. Like my boss would come down at four am in the morning and say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Kay, you&rsquo;re going to buff this entire floor&rdquo; that day. I wouldn&rsquo;t see my boss until the end of my shift. So I could put the boss trusted me to work on my own, y&rsquo;know. I guess I share that with you, just to let you know there&rsquo;s ways to make yourself look good, you just need to take the time to perfect it. It takes a lot of thought; it&rsquo;s a full time job figuring out how to make these resumes look good. Some people get paid big money to help people with that. (It&rsquo;s not me, though). Let me skip forward. So there&rsquo;s some pages here that allow you to just plug in some information, something you might be able to use. We&rsquo;ll just skip over that and go to cover letters for the last few minutes. Oh, so before we go. Honors and awards. Sometimes students question if they should put if they were an Eagle Scout. Not anymore, I don&rsquo;t think those are very legitimate anymore. It helped you a couple of years ago. Achievements/involvements/leadership, you put that when it&rsquo;s relevant. I hesitate a little to put that stuff. If you need a filler and it&rsquo;s pretty good and it&rsquo;s not too out there, go ahead and put it in. Have people read the page and ask them, &ldquo;Hey, does this look weird at the bottom Should I say I&rsquo;ve been a table tennis champion?&rdquo; So whatever it is, just be careful, because typically we don&rsquo;t need that stuff. Now sometimes it may be relevant. Now there was one time I applied for a job in Utah, the guy there I knew he was a big jazz fan, knew that he watched jazz games, get season tickets and stuff like that. I had some extra space, didn&rsquo;t have a lot of experience, at the end I put some hobbies and interests: basketball, watching sports. When I went into the interview, we talked a lot about it. Like at one point he was talking about season tickets, and I was like, &ldquo;Yeah, just imagine I could do all this stuff with my boss!&rdquo; I said to my wife. Didn&rsquo;t get the job, so I don&rsquo;t know what that should teach you, but sometimes it might work. It seems if you have an angle, it does. It just didn&rsquo;t in that case. So cover letters. Make it personable, make it its heading and paper the same as your resume. So make it look like your resume so that when they get it they think you&rsquo;re consistent. Have you ever seen that movie, <em>Legally Blonde</em>? Well, I&rsquo;ve seen it. She had like this resume that was pink and had a perfume on it. It smelled good. So if she&rsquo;s doing that, she better do it with her cover letter too, right? Don&rsquo;t do that, and don&rsquo;t watch that show. I watched it with my wife.</p>
<p>Proofread. Proofread. Same thing. Get other people&rsquo;s eyes on your cover letter, same thing. Make sure it looks good, make sure you catch everything. State why you&rsquo;re qualified and why you&rsquo;re the best candidate. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re baiting them, you&rsquo;re teasing them with this cover letter. Don&rsquo;t overwhelm them, don&rsquo;t rehash your resume. Get a bit more personable. Obviously it&rsquo;s in paragraph form, so it&rsquo;s a chance to show your writing skills. Again, this is something that even if you don&rsquo;t have very good writing skills, with the proper help, you taking advantage of resources on campus or elsewhere, you can make a good resume. Cover all of the qualifications in the job description. I want to spend a little time here with this. In fact, this is a letter, you should always address it. And the criteria states if the employer is a woman and you&rsquo;re not sure if she&rsquo;s married or not, what do you do? Ms. Capital M, lower case s, period. Makes you look sharp. Somebody once thought that it should be addressed to Sister. No! That will get you thrown out right away. Heading, first body paragraph, second body paragraph. There&rsquo;s this information in your packets, so we won&rsquo;t touch on this here too much. Specify that the first paragraph that you&rsquo;re going to specify the position you&rsquo;re applying for and how you meet those qualifications. I&rsquo;ve seen some people say &ldquo;I firmly believe&mdash;&ldquo; Well, not firmly believe&hellip; &ldquo;My education and experience qualify me for this position&rdquo; and they say something like that. In the next two paragraphs they have education in one paragraph, experience in the other. Maybe the word is bolded somewhere in the paragraph so it will stand out a little bit so that person can read the second paragraph with and know that this is the experience paragraph. Just make it very accessible and not too long. Read through your stuff on that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kay, but I do want to show you this. This is a genius way of applying for a job. So this is an actual job posting that is applicable to the majority of you. Only three of you and me can actually see it. This is a training specialist&hellip; Maybe I can zoom in on this. And what this person has done is that they&rsquo;ve printed out the job posting, they&rsquo;ve highlighted key words, things that&hellip; They were able to find priorities, somebody who can design a Power Point presentation, they&rsquo;ve highlighted all of these key words and qualifications that they&rsquo;ll need and they&rsquo;ve jotted them down on the side. So then what they&rsquo;ve done, which is pretty smart, is that they started to tailor their resume to make sure that they hit all of these points. So again, it&rsquo;s a little small, it&rsquo;s a little difficult to read, but they have all those same bullets pulled directly from the job description and they make sure they&rsquo;ve touched upon all of those things in their resume. Obviously you&rsquo;ve got to be honest, but typically we can find that stuff. So for example, design Power Point, they&rsquo;ve put it over here with designer training, yada yada yada. So they just made sure to touch upon all of those important things. So they&rsquo;re really working hard to make sure that what they&rsquo;re saying is what the employer wants to hear. And if you&rsquo;re honest and you&rsquo;re able to do that well, it&rsquo;s an awesome way to set things up. Another thing too is some employers will have a way to shift resumes. If you submit your resume online or through an application, you&rsquo;re not hitting on the points, if you&rsquo;re not hitting those words that they want to hear, your resume may be shifted out. That does happen at some businesses and some employers will just weed out a hundred of the applicants just because they didn&rsquo;t put the word &ldquo;facilitate.&rdquo; Or whatever. So if you can pull those words and those phrases from the job description and plug them into your resume, it&rsquo;s just a great way to do it. And they&rsquo;ve done the same thing here with their cover letter.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve taken some of these key words and they&rsquo;ve found what they think is the most important: training, adaptable, synthesize of research and such. These were the most important words they could find in the job description, so they can ensure to put those words in the cover letter. Again, they&rsquo;re really trying to speak to their audience. Sometimes we forgot the importance of that when we apply. We&rsquo;re so busy telling them what we&rsquo;ve done that we don&rsquo;t stop to think what they really want to hear. So that&rsquo;s just a great way to do it. It takes more time, but it can be really sharp and really helpful.</p>
<p>So this is just the last page that we&rsquo;ll just blip on, we&rsquo;re just about out of here. Let me pass these around too. I may have to sign more that those of you in the back get one. So just grab one of those and start pulling them out. So for your letter of recommendation, a couple of things that are important. On the last page, that first tip. Do your best in your academic courses. So if you&rsquo;re trying to get a letter of recommendation from your professor, obviously you need to be a good student. I want to stand on that a little bit. A lot of you, when you apply for jobs right out of college, they&rsquo;re going to watch a letter of recommendation and they may want one from one of your professors. Try to get in with one of your professors. When I went to school at BYU-Idaho, I kinda sat in the back, got kind of good grades, didn&rsquo;t really get to know my professors for whatever reason. So when I went to ask for a letter of recommendation, it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Hey Brother McDonald, you don&rsquo;t know me, I sat in the back in class&hellip;&rdquo; And it was just awkward. If you can get in with one of your professors, to know them well enough to ask for a letter of recommendation, it&rsquo;ll be better for you.</p>
<p>Now in the same breath, don&rsquo;t feel bad if you don&rsquo;t know them very well. A lot of professors, advisors, whoever, on campus. Employers will write you a letter of recommendation. It rubs their ego. Oh, this kid thinks I&rsquo;m good enough to write them a recommendation. Be sure you provide them with a clear timeline of when you need it. Feel free to follow up, and then this is key. Let&rsquo;s see, the fifth one down: make it easy for your recommender to know about you. My words are faded, I can&rsquo;t quite see it. I&rsquo;ve had some people, some busy employers say&mdash;Well, before I go there, be sure you get them a copy of your resume and a writing sample of what you&rsquo;ve accomplished. Even at your job. Maybe they&rsquo;re your boss and you want to let them know, &ldquo;Hey, this is what I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; A bit of a disconnect there. Give them all the information you can so they can write you a letter of recommendation. I&rsquo;ve had some bosses that were busy and were like, &ldquo;Hey, Vance, why don&rsquo;t you just write it for me, give it to me and I&rsquo;ll check over it, and I&rsquo;ll just put my name on it.&rdquo; Awesome. Means I can make myself sound awesome. But you may not have people do that, but be sure to get them enough good information about you so that they can feel a little bit more comfortable writing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kay, that&rsquo;s all of I have, do we have any questions? Any thoughts, comments? Yes, please.</p>
<p>STUDENT: I had a question regarding the education part of the letter. How would you recommend wording clusters? I&rsquo;m assuming that most don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, yes, I had to go over that last time! Clusters, oh clusters. Nobody knows what they are. Right? Your employer is like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a cluster?&rdquo; If you put like &ldquo;I had a cluster in&hellip;&rdquo; and in parenthesis put half a minor, that looks dumb too. So yeah.</p>
<p>STUDENT: So for these clusters, do you think there&rsquo;s any way there could be one for say we&rsquo;ve done so many hours in business, education, accounting?</p>
<p>KING: I like that. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll see students put full coursework in health science. Took 16 additional credits in health science, or whatever it is. Something else that they&rsquo;ll do is sometimes what they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll put bullets and put relevant courses. And if the courses are relevant, then they&rsquo;ll just list them, right? So they&rsquo;ll list additional relevant courses. Some students tell me that they put additional emphases in these areas. I like that. If you say additional emphases, you&rsquo;re not saying it&rsquo;s an additional emphases in your major, right, but that you&rsquo;ve done additional things. And the word emphases is a little more recognizable than cluster. So do that, and it&rsquo;s a great way to market your clusters, and if you choose to go with clusters, that&rsquo;s fine. It is a good way to show that you have diversity. Good question. Any other thoughts, questions? How many of you still need a slip? &lsquo;Kay, let me get some more of those for you. Come on up here and I&rsquo;ll just start signing them and flipping them out.</p>
