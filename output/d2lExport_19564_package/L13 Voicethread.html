            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Each week, we will have a Voice Thread assignment. This assignment will give you the opportunity to prepare and teach the math concepts that are being learned.</p>
            <p>To complete this assignment, click your group&apos;s Voice Thread link below. Then, select two questions on each slide that you will prepare and teach. Ensure that no one in your group has previously selected and taught the questions you&apos;ve
                picked.</p>
            <p>Once you have prepared your responses, use the microphone and/or webcam to teach the question to your group. You should also draw on the Voice Thread to help everyone see what you are doing. Once you have taught two questions from each slide,
                listen to other group members&apos; Voice Threads and reply to at least two other posts.</p>
