<h4>Case Study A</h4>
<p>Tim, a 46 yo African American M, presents himself to your clinic and tells you that he has been getting up to go to the bathroom 5 or 6 times every night. He also experiences lightheadedness and a ringing sound in his ears. From Tim&rsquo;s appearance, you can tell that he is overweight.

On physical exam, Tim&rsquo;s blood pressure is 164/102.</p>

<p>Betty, a 37 yo F, presents herself to your clinic and tells you she has been having headaches and dizzy spells lately. At night she&rsquo;ll have chest pain and her muscles will cramp up during the day.
