            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>For this first week, please write a little about yourself so we can get to know you. This activity will help you become acquainted with those who are gathering with you in this course, so it will be more comfortable to collaborate throughout
                the course.</p>
            <p>Introduce yourself to the class in a few short paragraphs by starting a new discussion board thread. Give your introduction a title and then start your post on the next line.</p>
            <ul>
                <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li>Post a head shot picture to identify yourself in the class. Follow this link for <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">directions for posting pictures</a>.</li>]</span></strong> 
                <li>Also, in your thread, talk about something that you like or something that shows more about you (i.e. hobby, family, sports, music, reading, or other).</li>
                <li>After you have posted your own information, read and respond to at least three of your classmates&apos; posts. You might explain the connection (perhaps you lived in the same area, served in the same mission, share hobbies, etc.) or you
                    might ask a question about something they said. Respond sincerely. Use this activity to really begin to get to know and connect with your classmates.</li>
            </ul>
