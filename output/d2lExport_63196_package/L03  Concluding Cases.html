<h4>Case Study A</h4>
<p>Clarence is a 35 yo M who is brought into your clinic by his girlfriend. She tells you that Clarence has been hallucinating and telling her "they're after me" over and over, but she has no idea what he's talking about. As you do a physical examination, you notice that his pupils are dilated and he has needle marks in his arms. You ask if he has ever used drugs and Clarence firmly denies ever using them.</p>
<h4>Case Study B</h4>
<p>Margaret is an 18 yo F who is brought to your clinic by her mother. Margaret was supposed to graduate from high school this year, but she was held back due to some poor grades in her classes. Her mom thinks Margaret may have dyslexia due to her poor grades. Margaret says she was forced to take achievement tests and she was told she was at a sixth grade learning level.</p>
<h4>Case Study C</h4>
<p>Betsy is an 8 yo F who is brought to your clinic by her parents. Her parents tell you Betsy was kicked out of her school because of her disruptive behavior during class. You try to ask Betsy what happened, but she won't look at you and repeatedly fidgets with a blanket that her parents tell you she takes everywhere. Her parents also tell you that Betsy seems uninterested in playing with the other children at school and she knocked over a fish tank in the classroom because she didn't like the noises the tank made.</p>

<h4>Case Study D</h4>
<p>Johnny is a 6 yo M who is brought to your clinic by his mother. She is worried about Johnny because this past school year he was always getting in trouble for getting out of his seat when he wasn't supposed to. At home he gets easily distracted from his chores, and when they go to the store he runs around and she can't seem to control him.</p>
<h4>Case Study E</h4>
<p>Lucille is a 19 yo F who is brought to your clinic by her mother. Her mom is worried because Lucille avoids eating with the family unless she's forced to, and when she does, she only pushes the food around on her plate. She is constantly going to the gym and has lost a lot of weight in the past few months. You ask Lucille when her last period was, and she tells you she has not had one for about six months.</p>
<h4>Case Study F</h4>
<p>Beverly is an 18 yo F who has been brought to your clinic by a concerned roommate. The roommate tells you she saw Beverly eating a lot of junk food this morning and when she came home from her classes, she found Beverly throwing up in the bathroom. Beverly dropped out of her classes and has been hiding in her room for the past month, which is unusual for her.</p>

<h4>Case Study G</h4>
<p>Randy is a 30 yo M who comes to your clinic. He tells you he has had constant genital pain for the past few weeks. He also explains that after intercourse he experiences severe discomfort.</p>
<h4>Case Study H</h4>
<p>Marvin is a 40 yo M who presents to your clinic and tells you he has had issues having intercourse. He tells you that he really loves his wife and he's attracted to her, but he just can't seem to "last long enough" to have intercourse.</p>
<h4>Case Study I</h4>
<p>Esther is a 35 yo F who presents to your clinic with her husband. She tells you that she seems to have lost her desire to have a sexual relationship with her husband even though she loves him very much. She tells you that the things her husband used to do to arouse her seem to have no affect on her anymore.</p>
<h4>Case Study J</h4>
<p>Earl is a 46 yo M who presents to your clinic and tells you he has been having issues with having intercourse. He tells you that every time he and his wife begin any foreplay, he automatically expulses seminal fluid and they sometimes don't even get to the actual intercourse.</p>
