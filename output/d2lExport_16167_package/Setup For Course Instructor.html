<h1>General Setup for Instructor</h1>
<hr />
<p>Complete the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/onlineadjunct/checklist.htm" target="_blank">Instructor Pre-Semester Checklist</a></p>
<p>Ensure that your Instructor Profile is updated with your Office Hours and other information. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on your name in the upper-right corner of I-Learn and then choose "Profile" from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click the Change Picture button and upload your BYU-I professional photo. It must be a small version of it to fit.</li>
<li>Include other information that you would like your students to see. Under "Homepage," enter your Adobe Connect link (https://byui.adobeconnect.com/... (the beginning of your email address). Under the Contact Information section, be sure to include your phone number and email address. Students can click your image anywhere in the course and it will bring up your profile page. Likewise, you can do the same for students.</li>
<li>Open your course from the Select a Course dropdown menu in the top black minibar and click in Content. Find the Welcome module and click the drop down menu next to the Welcome page and select "Edit HTML." Update this page with your contact information along with other information you'd like your students to see. This is the introduction of yourself the students will see.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Course-Specific Setup for Instructor:</h2>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the recommended course schedule and the Lesson Notes for the course. Here is a listing of some of the external tools used in this course. These are also discussed in the lesson notes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALEKS:</strong> This is an assessment tool that responds to students' mastery of the material. Students must pass an ALEKS exam for physics with an 80% before starting work in the course. Students have a free three-hour trial of ALEKS or a free two week trial. If they cannot pass the exam at 80% in this timeframe, they will need to pay a fee ($19.95 for a one month subscription) to continue working on the problems until they achieve 80% mastery. Instructions for doing this are listed in the Resources folder. If students are having issues with ALEKS on their specific computers, you can refer them to the ALEKS Customer Support page here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aleks.com/support/contact_support_highered" target="_blank">http://www.aleks.com/support/contact_support_highered</a></li>
<li><strong>Groups:&nbsp;</strong>You will need to enroll your students into the&nbsp;Small Group Discussions. Go to "More Tools" - "Groups" - hit the drop down arrow on "Small Groups" - "Enroll Users" -&nbsp;Put 5 people in each group by clicking the boxes under SG1, SG2, SG3, etc. - Click save.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>TA's:</strong> There will be a TA hired by the Mechanical Engineering Department on campus to grade all the homework assignments from both the online sections and the in-class sections of ME 201. The TA needs to be added to all sections of the course each semester. Contact Kenna Carter (208.496.7631) to find out who the TA will be each semester.</li>
<li><strong>Student Mentors:</strong>&nbsp;In<strong>&nbsp;</strong>addition to the TA, there will be several student mentors assigned to your section. Student mentors are students who have taken this class previously, and passed with a B or better. You will receive a list of the student mentors assigned to your section from Kenna Carter. You need to send a request to the Course Improvement Team to add these students to your section. Use the following form:&nbsp;<a href="https://web.byui.edu/Portfolio/OnlineCourses/improvement" target="_blank">https://web.byui.edu/Portfolio/OnlineCourses/improvement</a>. Include your section number along with the full name and school email address of each student mentor. In the form, let the Course Improvement Team know that you want these students to be given view and edit rights in the course.&nbsp;The Course Improvement Team will add these student mentors to your course so they can help students as you direct them.&nbsp;You can direct these mentors to help students by monitoring group discussion boards, setting up one-on-one online tutoring sessions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematica / CDF Player:</strong> Students will either need to download Mathematica or the Wolfram CDF PLayer. In the earlier lessons, there are interactive math visualizations called CDF (computable document format) files that can only be opened in Mathematica or the Wolfram CDF Player. Mathematica is an extensive computational program that students can download for free with a license from the university. The CDF Player is free to anyone. Its only function is to display CDF files. Download instructions for both programs are included in the course Resources folder.</li>
<li><strong>Twiddla:</strong> This is a free, online whiteboard tool. There is no setup required for this resource. Students simply need to access the URL, which is provided in the course starting in Lesson 02 Basic Group Question and Answer board.</li>
<li><strong>Maple TA:&nbsp;</strong>Majority of the Quizzes in this course will be in Maple TA. Instructors must create and connect Maple TA course to your I-learn course.&nbsp;<span><span>The following steps will guide you to ensure correct setup of your Maple TA course.</span></span>
<ol>
<li>In the resource folder in the content area, click the Maple TA link and follow these<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNKEBblpEIvpPy77w1X7QAuxMxXtHIXzLc3P6GZ-lRY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> instructions</a>. Inherit the "Online - Course semester - Course Title " for example; Online - Fall 2017 - ME 101 &nbsp;</li>
<li>Connect any additional links (if any) to the new Maple TA course. Follow these <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdlYITUB79_JNFMuXLri6s0ZciQ9fsQHis0atEX6no4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">instructions</a>&nbsp;to connect the remaining links to Maple TA.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Follow these <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wr198uBE5KkGvJISapfx6112-go_R7RW8E8OHfK2bB0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">instructions</a> to setup a grade report in Maple TA. Refer to the following document for specific report group names, settings and associations - <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/3c80280b-e7f5-446f-94d2-c9ee1fa37b87/2/ME201_MapleTAGradeReportSetup.pdf" target="_blank">ME201_MapleTAGradeReportSetup.pdf</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample Email:</h2>
<p>Send out an e-mail the first week of class to let your class know that they will hit the ground running with their online class. Here is a sample email you can send out the first week of class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Welcome to ME 201! I'm excited to experience this course with you. We're going to hit the ground running this first week. Be sure and post your picture to the Personal Information in the "Getting to Know You Discussion Board". Click http://<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[stream.byui.edu]</span></strong> /tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf for a 2-minute walkthrough on how to do this. &nbsp;I'll see you in the Getting to Know You Discussion Board. Remember at anyone enrolled in ME 201 is required to demonstrate proficiency in math fundamentals by achieving a minimum composite score of 80% on the ALEKS Math Prep for College Physics course. See the ALEKS document for additional information. The ALEKS test can take anywhere from 3-4 hours to complete so plan accordingly. Remember that<strong> </strong>FDMAT 112 is a co-requisite for the class, which gives you a basic understanding of college algebra and calculus. I look forward to working with you in this class."</p>
