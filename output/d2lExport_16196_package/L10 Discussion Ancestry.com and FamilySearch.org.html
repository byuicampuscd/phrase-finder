<h1>Lesson 10: Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org</h1>
<p><strong>Discussion Board | Worth 10 points | Due by:</strong> End-of-Week</p>
<hr />
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>FamilySearch.org has a growing number of records and resources for German research. Some of these key records and resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital records online</li>
<li>FamilySearch Research Wiki</li>
<li>FamilySearch Catalog</li>
<li>Digital books</li>
</ul>
<h2>Digital Records Online</h2>
<p>The number of digital images available at FamilySearch.org is continually growing. The collection includes indexed and un-indexed records. Both record types can be accessed through <a href="https://familysearch.org/search" target="_blank" title="Search">Search</a>. The indexed records are searchable through the provided search box.</p>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p>Using available filters helps limit the number of responses. Watch the following training video if you need a refresher course on using filters in searching the indexed online records: <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1555199317001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAsMO7iuE~,0a6boL_aMzRRMejnsVF7dLsOY4w3QTnL&amp;bclid=1553564665001&amp;bctid=1553792919001" target="_blank" title="Searching Records - Filters">Searching Records - Filters</a>.</p>]</span></strong> 
<p>The un-indexed records may be searched by identifying an individual collection, and then browsing the images in that collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find German record collections, click on "Search," then click "Records."&nbsp; Under "Find a Collection," choose to "Browse all published collections."&nbsp; You can narrow the list down using the place, date, and collection (record type) filters to the left, or by filtering by entering keywords from the collection names. Read the "<a href="https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/Select_Specific_Records" target="_blank">Select Specific Records</a>" and the "<a href="https://familysearch.org/node/1545" target="_blank">Using the FamilySearch Records Collections</a>" wiki articles if you need a refresher course on locating a specific record collection on FamilySearch.</p>
<h2>FamilySearch Research Wiki</h2>
<p>The FamilySearch research wiki is a community-based resource dedicated to genealogical information. Contributions by the entire genealogical community are encouraged. The following link will lead you to the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Germany" target="_blank" title="German Portal Page">German Portal Page</a>. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the page and available links. If you need a review of the Wiki in general, watch the following overview video: <a href="http://broadcast.lds.org/elearning/FHD/Community/en/Community/Jane_Colmenares/Researching_in_the_FamilySearch_Wiki___An_Overview/Player.html" target="_blank" title=" Family Search Wiki - an Overview">Family Search Wiki - an Overview</a>.</p>
<h2>FamilySearch Catalog</h2>
<p>The FamilySearch Catalog is the portal in which to determine all of the holdings of FamilySearch. Previous lessons have focused on how to navigate the catalog. If you need a refresher course, read the "<a href="https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/Using_the_FamilySearch_Catalog" target="_blank">Using the FamilySearch Catalog</a>" wiki article.</p>
<h2>Digital Books</h2>
<p>Digital reference books can be found by searching for books, such as Meyers Orts- und Verkehrs Lexikon, in the FamilySearch Catalog. If the book has been digitized, the catalog record will include a link to it in digital form. The <a href="http://books.familysearch.org/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=1&amp;dstmp=1366764930980&amp;vid=FHD_PUBLIC&amp;fromLogin=true" target="_blank" title="Books">Books</a> collection at FamilySearch includes the books that have been digitized by FamilySearch, Allen County Public Library, Brigham Young Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University Hawaii Joseph F. Smith Library, Church History Library, Family History Library, Houston Public Library-Clayton Library for Genealogical Research, and the Mid-Continent Public Library - Midwest Genealogical Center. Future collaboration with other institutions is possible.</p>
<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>Other resources that may help you with German research on FamilySearch.org include the FamilySearch Family Tree and other submitted genealogies. The following training video is available for training on Family Tree: <a href="https://familysearch.org/learningcenter/lesson/quick-start-to-family-tree/741" target="_blank">Quick Start to Family Tree</a>. The Genealogies tab at FamilySearch contains information gathered from the Ancestral File and Pedigree Resource File. If a review of these resources would be helpful, read the following articles:&nbsp; <a href="https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Ancestral_File" target="_blank" title="Ancestral File">Ancestral File</a> and <a href="https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Pedigree_Resource_File" target="_blank" title="Pedigree Resource File">Pedigree Resource File</a> located in the FamilySearch wiki.</p>
<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<p>FamilySearch and Ancestry both have numerous German record collections and other resources available online. Some of their collections overlap; others are unique to one site or another. Each site has advantages and disadvantages for searching and navigation. Whether to use one or the other generally depends on which website has the record collections needed for a research problem. Successful research is usually achieved by using the two websites in tandem.</p>
<p>You have just completed the activities, Finding German Collections on Ancestry.com, and Finding German Collections on FamilySearch.org. At the beginning of these activities, you were given the following instructions: "As you explore the various ways of finding German record collections, keep track of the results, as you will use them later completing the 'Comparing Ancestry and FamilySearch Assignment.'"
