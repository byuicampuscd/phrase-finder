            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This introductory course in macroeconomics studies the national economy as a whole and its interaction with the global economy. Measurement of economic health and the use of fiscal and monetary policies to address unemployment, inflation,
                and growth are analyzed.</p>
            <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
            <p>This course has been designed to follow a weekly schedule in which students complete one lesson per week. You are expected to complete all of the learning activities for each lesson in the order they are listed. Also, you should complete each
                lesson in order and not skip ahead without finishing a lesson. For example, complete all the learning activities in Lesson 01 before beginning any learning activities in Lesson 02. The instructor may shift the order of completion for some
                assignments, and may even extend the deadlines on a few assignments if circumstances warrant it for the whole class.</p>
            <p>Due dates and times for all assignments may be found by accessing the Calendar tool in I-Learn. In addition, all required assignments and tests have been set up to appear in the &#x201C;Due Soon&#x201D; list that you will see whenever you
                log in to I-Learn. Also, all activity directions will have information on when the assignment or assessment opens and when it closes (due date and time). These due dates and times listed in the activity directions are based on Mountain
                Time in the United States of America, and are set up to be aligned with the due dates and times of students on campus at BYU-Idaho. If you are in a different time zone, you may see some adjustments for your own time zone in the I-Learn
                Calendar and Due Soon list. If you have any questions about when an assignment is due, you should contact your instructor.</p>
            <p>The deans of the colleges at BYU-Idaho have determined that the average amount of study time that students will put in per week per credit is 3 to 4 hours. So, for a 3-credit class, the deans expect students to spend on average between 9 and
                12 hours of total study time. For this course, on average, it will take students approximately 9 hours of study time to complete all the learning activities for each lesson. This is the amount of time that you should expect to put into
                this class each week if you want to get a passing &#x201C;C&#x201D; grade. If you want a higher grade, you may need to put in more study time; maybe even beyond 12 hours per week. Students working towards an A or B grade will usually need
                to put in more study time than 9 hours a week. Consequently, in order to keep up with the assignments and learn the most from this class, you should make sure you schedule about 1 to 2 hours a day to study for this class. Also, be aware
                that with this course, there is no &#x201C;time off&#x201D; for holidays that might occur during the week. Consequently, you should make sure to arrange your study schedule so that any holiday activities do not keep you from completing
                learning activities by the posted due dates and times.</p>
            <h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
            <p>The course has been designed to follow a weekly schedule in which students complete one lesson per week. You are expected to complete all of the learning activities for each lesson in the order they are listed for each lesson. The instructor
                may shift the order of completion for some assignments, and may even extend the deadlines on a few assignments if circumstances warrant it for the whole class.</p>

            <h3>Homework, Quizzes, and Assessments</h3>
            <p>Each lesson has an assigned course individual preparation assignment (not turned in for a grade), lesson group quiz, homework assignment, and quiz. Each of the homework and quiz assignments will be completed in Connect. The reading preparation
                assignment will be a reading outline along with the questions that will be on the lesson group quiz. These questions should be answered before you meet with your group to take the group quiz. It will not be turned in for a grade, but it
                is essential that it is complete before you take the group quiz. You will take a group quiz that will have the same questions that are given as part of the individual preparation assignment. The group quiz will be taken on Google Hangouts.
                Instructions on how to take the group quiz will be provided on I-Learn. The homework questions may be attempted twice with no penalty and may be completed using notes and other study materials. Quizzes are also open book but each question
                may only be attempted once. However, you may &#x201C;check your answer&#x201D; once during the quiz, but it results in a 25% deduction on the value of the question. There are no time limits imposed for any of these assignments.</p>
            <h3>Other Activities</h3>
            <p>In addition to the weekly homework and quiz assignments, there are other activities in I-Learn and Connect to better familiarize you with the material and also to allow you to ask questions and share ideas for improvement. These activities
                are arranged so that by working through them from top-to-bottom will be most beneficial for you. Many of these activities will also be graded and will account for a portion of your final grade.</p>
            <h3>LearnSmart Modules - Extra Credit</h3>
            <p>The LearnSmart modules will need to be completed by the end of each lesson. If they are completed with a score of 100%, then you will receive one point of extra credit towards the exam. If you score less than 100%, then you will receive less
                than one point of extra credit on the exam.</p>
            <h3>Exams</h3>
            <p>Each exam will be taken online in Connect. You will have a time limit of three hours to take the exam. Exams 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 50 questions worth two points each. Each exam will be counted toward your final grade.</p>
            <p>Instruction for taking the Exams</p>
            <p>Each of the three exams are closed notes and must be taken in a proctored setting. Students within 30 miles of campus are expected to take the exams in the Testing Center. Students outside the 30-mile radius must find an approved proctor.</p>
            <p>To find and request an approved proctor, refer to the website about details for finding a qualified proctor:</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.byui.edu/testing-services/proctoring" target="_blank">http://www.byui.edu/testing-services/proctoring</a></p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the student to contact the proctor to set up an appointment to take each individual exam. Please allow 2 full business days, prior to the exam, for the Testing Center to provide instructions to the proctor.</p>

            <p>(Note: The LearnSmart modules will be extra credit assignments offered during the course, through the semester; they must be completed by the end of each lesson. For each LearnSmart module completed with 100%, you will receive one point of
                extra credit on the associated exam. If you score 50% on the LearnSmart module you will receive 0.5 points that will go towards the associated exam.)</p>
            <p>In assigning final grades for this course, the instructor will use the BYU-Idaho Standard Grade Definition criteria listed below.</p>
            <h5>A</h5>
            <p>The grade of &#x201C;A&#x201D; represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems.
                It demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.</p>
            <h5>B</h5>
            <p>The grade of &#x201C;B&#x201D; represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material, which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school, or employment. The student
                participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.</p>
            <h5>C</h5>
            <p>The grade of &#x201C;C&#x201D; represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging.
                The student participates marginally in the Learning Model.</p>
            <h5>D</h5>
            <p>The grade of &#x201C;D&#x201D; represents poor performance and initiative to learn, understand, and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.</p>
            <h5>F</h5>
            <p>The grade of &#x201C;F&#x201D; represents failure in the course.</p>

            <p>Principles of Personal Honor&#x2014;&#x201C;True at all Times&#x201D;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal honor is integrity in fulfilling commitments, responsibilities, and covenants.</li>
                <li>Personal honor begins with willing obedience, and is fully developed when we consistently govern ourselves by true principles.</li>
                <li>Personal honor increases spiritual strength through the ministry of the Holy Ghost.</li>
                <li>Personal honor is central to every aspect of our lives, including the BYU-Idaho experience.</li>
                <li>Personal honor brings us joy and happiness, deepens our desire to love, serve, and lift others, and ultimately helps us to become more like the Savior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You should make sure that you understand the above principles of personal honor. It is important for all class members to strive to follow the above principles in our associations with one another.</p>
