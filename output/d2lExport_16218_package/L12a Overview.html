            <h1 class="LessonPlanTitle">Communication &amp; Mutual Problem Solving</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>&quot;Your most important friendships should be with your own brothers and sisters and with your father and mother. Love your family. Be loyal to them. Have a genuine concern for your brothers and sisters. Help carry their load so you can
                say, like the lyrics of the song, &apos;He ain&apos;t heavy; he&apos;s my brother&apos;.&quot;<br> -President Ezra Taft Benson</p>

            <p>Having just discussed common and less-common crises as they influence families we are prepared to discuss challenges and opportunities associated with communication and mutual problem solving.</p>
            <p>We commonly recognize communication as an important issue in families, but we may not adequately recognize how tone and non-verbal communication impact our cooperation. Few families have formalized ways of making decisions together. We will
                explore some options for families&#x2014;especially married couples&#x2014;for making decisions effectively.</p>

                <li>Take the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16218&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-225832" target="_blank">Reading Quiz</a><strong>&#xA0;</strong>for this week. (15 min)</li>
                <li>Read M. Russell Ballard, also &#x201C;<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel?lang=eng" target="_blank">Strength in Counsel</a>&#x201D;, General Conference, October 1993.</li>
                <li>Read &#x201C;<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils?lang=eng&amp;query=ballard+counseling" target="_blank">Counseling with Our Councils</a>&#x201D;, General Conference, April 1994.(Note that
                    Elder Ballard discussed this principle and practice in two consecutive General Conferences. In his book he stated that he had first taught the principles, then traveled to various ward and stake councils throughout the world to see
                    how well the leaders had understood and responded to his direction. &#x201C;Without exception&#x201D; these bishops and stake presidents failed to head his counsel, though they were convinced that they were doing it properly. As a
                    result of the obvious misunderstandings regarding this critical and eternal principle he wrote the book, Counseling with our Councils: Learning to minister together in the church and in the family. (2003, p.4)</li>

                    of their respective experiences with the council system or counsel method of mutual decision making. (Note: Cleon Skousen was not a general authority of the Church, but refers to a particular assignment he received relative to Tabernacle
                    Choir broadcasts in the 1950&#x2019;s. His remarks are pulled from a recorded lecture regarding the founding of the United States Constitution.) <strong>Please listen carefully as these brethren describe their actual experiences with this sacred process for seeking and responding to challenges and opportunities via the counsel method.</strong>                    It would be wisest to view this in conjunction with reading the &#x201C;Counseling with our Councils&#x201D; readings.
