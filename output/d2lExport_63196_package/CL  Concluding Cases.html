<h4>Case Study A</h4>
<p>Cindy, a 26 yo F, is having a difficult time emptying her bladder fully, pain upon urination and today reports a slight fever. Your assistant in the clinic conducts a clean catch urine sample and completed a dipstick U/A. There are high levels of white blood cells in the urine.</p>
<h4>Case Study B</h4>
<p>James, a 35 yo M, reports to your clinic with pain in his lower back, isolated to the right side. He has noticed that his urine is very cloudy and last night he had to get up multiple times to void. His temperature is 102.8 F (39.3 C).</p>
<h4>Case Study C</h4>
<p>Brooke, a 29 yo F, is having pain in her lower back and blood in her urine. You decide an ultrasound is warranted and find that the kidneys are covered with large sacs of fluid.</p>

<h4><span>Case Study D</span></h4>
<p>Joe, a 71 yo M, with diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure has been under your care for over ten years. He has started to have less urine output over the past week. The home health nurse reports that he has been very drowsy and lethargic recently as well. You test his blood for BUN and Creatinine levels and they are both elevated.</p>
<h4>Case Study E</h4>
<p>Ann, a 57 yo F with multiple sclerosis, is visiting with you today because she is having a difficult time controlling her bladder. &ldquo;I just feel like I have to use the restroom every five minutes, and when I get there, it is hard to urinate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Case Study F</h4>
<p>Nate, a 67 yo M with a history of smoking for 50 years, is waking up at night multiple times to urinate. The past two days he has noticed &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; of blood in his urine. He is not in any pain, but he was concerned, so he came in.</p>
<h4>Case Study G</h4>
<p>Dustin, a 52 yo M, has been a welder for 30 years. He is having lower back pain (on his side) for about the last two months. The other day he could feel a large lump when he was rubbing the side of his abdomen. You also feel the lump. You order a CT but have a strong suspicion that the lump is a tumor.</p>
