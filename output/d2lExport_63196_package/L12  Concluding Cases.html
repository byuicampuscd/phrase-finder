<h4>Case Study A</h4>
<p>Rebecca, a 29 yo F, is being seen today for complaint of eye pain. She tells you that yesterday, her infant child reached up and accidentally poked her in the eye. There was no blood, but it feels &ldquo;like something is in my eye, even when it is closed.&rdquo; Her eye is red, but you do not see a foreign object in the eye.</p>
<h4>Case Study B</h4>
<p>Viola, a 67 yo F, presents with complaints of a gradual decrease in vision in both the eyes over the past two years. She has not been able to read or sew for a while, and she has a difficult time recognizing people until they get very close. Watching television has become increasingly difficult for her. You look at Viola and see that both eyes look like they have a cloudy or milky substance over the Iris.</p>
<h4>Case Study C</h4>
<p>Tyson, a 31 yo M, is being seen by his optometrist for a follow-up to his recent LASIK surgery. He has been putting steroid drops in his eyes as directed by the surgeon. His vision is the best it has been, but yesterday he started seeing halos while driving at night. He also explains a dull aching pain in his eye. You complete a tonometer evaluation and find that his intraocular pressure is extremely high.</p>

<h4>Case Study D</h4>
<p>Harold, a 70 yo M, is accompanied to the clinic by his oldest daughter. He is not happy to be there. His daughter tells you that &ldquo;dad is getting very dangerous when he is driving. In fact, yesterday he pulled into an intersection right in front of another car!&rdquo; Harold mumbles, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it there.&rdquo; After further questioning Harold admits that his left eye has a black spot right in the middle of his vision &ldquo;but I can see around it most of the time, except when I try to do something up close.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Case Study E</h4>
<p>Aubrey brings in her baby girl, Karen, for her 6 month checkup. Everything looks good except that Karen&rsquo;s right eye is turned inward (towards her nose) and her left eye is focusing straight ahead at you. Aubrey said she noticed Karen&rsquo;s eye, but didn&rsquo;t think anything of it because she had seen it with a brother and a niece. You recommend an evaluation by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<h4>Case Study F</h4>
<p>Brittney, a 4 yo F, is brought to our clinic with a swollen red left eye. There is thick discharge that has started to dry up on the outside of the eyelashes. When she opens her eye wide, the white part of Brittney&rsquo;s eye is bright pink.</p>

<h4>Case Study G</h4>
<p>37 yo M, Jackson has been one of your HIV/AIDS patients for three years now. He presents himself to your clinic this morning wearing large dark sunglasses because any bright light causes intense irritation. He has noticed blurred vision and eye pain for about a week now. You notice when he takes his glasses off that his right pupil does not constrict in the light.</p>
<h4>Case Study H</h4>
<p>Jazmine, a 17 yo F, presents herself to your clinic with irritated eyes. She is constantly rubbing them. As you examine her eyes, you notice that the lining of the eyelid right below the eyelash is swollen and red. You ask if she has noticed if her eye lashes are falling out, and she says, &ldquo;Yes. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Case Study I</h4>
<p>Alex, a 23 yo M, is seen in your clinic for irritated, red eyes with an irritation to light. His eyes are excreting a thick white discharge. You notice that he has two sores that are healing on his upper lip. Asking about his history you find out that he just got over a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and that those blisters on his lip showed up right in the middle of his &ldquo;cold.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Case Study J</h4>
<p>Dexter, a 16 yo M, comes in for pain and &ldquo;itchiness&rdquo; in his left ear. There is a yellowish crusty discharge coming out of his ear. As you look inside, the ear canal is a bright red color. The tympanic membrane looks gray and normal. It is summer time, and Dexter and his friends frequently dive off rocks in &ldquo;the quarry.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Case Study K</h4>
<p>Kristin, an 18-month-old girl, is brought to your clinic by her mother. The mother explains that Kristin is very restless and &ldquo;grouchy.&rdquo; She has a slight fever. She awakes during her naps and at night with a painful cry. She is also rubbing the side of her face and right ear.</p>
<h4>Case Study L</h4>
<p>Christina, a 31 yo F, has come to your clinic for ringing in the ears (or tinnitus). She says that she is having a hard time hearing her husband talk to her as well: &ldquo;It sounds like he is mumbling all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Case Study M</h4>
<p>Camilla, a 24 yo F, is planning a post-graduation cruise with her friends. However, she is very nervous that she won&rsquo;t have a good time, saying, &ldquo;Every time I fly or drive in the car for more than about one hour, I get nauseated and feel like the world is spinning around me. Can you help me have a good time on my cruise?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Case Study N</h4>
<p>Dan, a 47 yo M, was shopping for Christmas gifts with his wife. He started to feel very dizzy and had to sit down. After a minute, he had an intense ringing in his ears and it became very difficult to hear anything. This is the second time in about a year that this has happened. That is why Dan is at the clinic today.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Case Study O</h4>
<p>Jasper, a 56 yo M, has been an auto mechanic for 35 years. Over the past two years, it has been more difficult for Jasper to clearly hear conversations. He frequently asks his wife to stop mumbling and has started to avoid large gatherings. His wife tells you that he &ldquo;turns up the TV way too loud.&rdquo;</p>
