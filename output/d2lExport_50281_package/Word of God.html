<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To complete Principle One requirements, follow the instructions for each learning activity listed below as indicated by the arrows and then complete the learning assessment at the end. <strong>Before you can open the assessment at the bottom of the page, you'll be asked if you have completed each learning activity as instructed.</strong></p>
<p>As you work through each of the activities below, consider finding answers to the following two statements in preparation for completing the learning assessment:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what ways could applying Principle One of the Learning Model help solve the challenges found in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>You are taking an economics class that seems too hard to understand. You struggle to grasp some of the concepts and numbers. This lack of knowledge is embarrassing to you. You do not want your classmates or friends to know that you are quickly falling behind so you decide not to ask questions in class and to just figure things out on your own.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Identify and list insights or principles from each learning activity below that can be applied to your own learning and studies as you seek to apply Principle One of the Learning Model.</li>
</ol>
<p>We invite you to take notes of your insights and impressions as you complete each activity.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle Three below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Laying hold upon the Word of God in the scriptures and in the words of the prophets signifies our faith in, the priority of, and the importance of the Word of God at BYU-Idaho. The Word of God is the anchor. It is the standard and lens by which all things in every discipline are measured and evaluated. We seek excellence in our academic disciplines as we strive to understand them in the light of the restored gospel. Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho seek to master the learning and knowledge of their respective disciplines, but they do not "lay hold" on that knowledge if it conflicts with the Word of God. When learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho use the Word of God in this way, they are able to "lay hold upon every good thing" (Moroni 7:25).</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><strong><em>Spencer W. Kimball</em></strong></p>
<p>"Many in the secular world are often adrift and anchorless. Only an education which educates for eternity has the wholeness which humans need. When we separate learning from divine moral truth it quickly deteriorates into a restless, roving search for meaning and often drifts into a sensual selfishness" (Edward L. Kimball, <em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</em> 1982, pg. 387).</p>
<p><strong><em>Brigham Young</em></strong></p>
<p>"The philosophy of the heavens and the earth of the worlds that are, that were, and that are yet to come into existence, is all the Gospel that we have embraced. Every true philosopher, so far as he understands the principles of truth, has so much of the Gospel, and so far he is a Latter-day Saint, whether he knows it or not. Our Father, the great God, is the author of the sciences, he is the great mechanic, he is the systematizer of all things, he plans and devises all things, and every particle of knowledge which man has in his possession is the gift of God." (Discourses of Brigham Young, 2 - 3)</p>
