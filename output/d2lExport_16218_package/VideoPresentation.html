            <p>Watch the following video/presentation as part of this week&apos;s learning. It is has been prepared by Brother Gardner of the Department of Home &amp; Family to help students become better prepared to examine social science or statements
                and articles referencing the research.</p>
            <p>Being well&#xA0; informed regarding social science research may help us to develop a &#x201C;healthy skepticism&#x201D; regarding information and opinions presented. Being a wise consumer of research will help you to form more educated opinions,
                make wiser decisions relative to your own families, and help you to speak authoritatively on a variety of topics. Of course it will also help you with your studies in this class and throughout your education.</p>

            <p>Make sure that you use headphones or speakers for all of the videos and presentations during this semester, as several of them have audio features.</p>
