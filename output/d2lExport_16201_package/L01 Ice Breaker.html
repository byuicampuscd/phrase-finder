<h1>Lesson 01: Ice Breaker</h1>
<p><strong>Discussion Board&nbsp;| Worth 4 points | Initial Post Due: </strong>Midweek |&nbsp;<strong>Response Due:</strong> End-of-Week</p>
<hr />
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Get to know each other! This activity will help you become acquainted with those who are gathering with you in this class so that it will be more comfortable to collaborate throughout the course.</p>
<h3>Initial Post</h3>
<p>Introduce yourself in a few short paragraphs (100&ndash;150 words) to the class by starting a new discussion thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click &ldquo;Start a New Thread&rdquo; to begin your post.</li>
<li>Use the first 50 characters to give your introduction a title, and then start your post on the next line.</li>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li>Post a " headshot" picture to identify yourself in the class. Follow this link for <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">directions</a>&nbsp;for posting pictures.</li>]</span></strong> 
<li>Remember that this picture is the image your instructor and classmates will see to identify you for the entire semester. Remember that first impressions last a long time.</li>
<li>Post a headshot picture of yourself. Please do not post a picture of your wife, your dog, a tree, or you and your spouse together, etc. The instructor wants to see you! (You can post other pictures in the actual message that you post. See the bullet below.)</li>
<li>Ensure that your headshot picture follows the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a>&nbsp;in the BYU-Idaho Honor Code. This includes everything from appropriate dress, countenance, and poses. Although you are not taking this class on campus, the same standards must be observed off-campus. Inappropriate and distracting faces and gestures may not be used.</li>
<li>Also, in your thread, include a personal family story or an experience you have had related to family history.</li>
</ul>
