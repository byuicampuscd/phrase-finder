<p><strong>Topic: Feeding Children</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to answer:</em> What is the best way to feed children?</p>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p>Much of what we choose to eat as adults depends on what we learn to eat as children. Caregivers are responsible for deciding what foods are offered and when and where they should be eaten. Read the Ellyn Satter Division of Responsibility in Feeding <em>(<a href="Ellyn_Satter_Division_Responsibility.dor2013.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>)</em>. Watch the "Feeding Baby Lauren" video <em>(<a href="http://stream.byui.edu/VideoPlayer/BYUIplayer.html?StartCue=1035&amp;EndCue=1377&amp;VideoName=4100.vcs&amp;VideoType=libraryvideos" target="_blank" title="Feeding Baby Lauren Video">click here</a>)</em>. Read The Family: A Proclamation to the World (<a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation" target="_blank" title="The Family: A Proclamation to the World"><em>click here</em></a>).</p>]</span></strong> 
<p><em>Ideas for discussion:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong> List some creative, healthy snacks that you might give to your children. Include some ideas for managing childhood food aversion.</li>
<li><strong>Breadth:</strong> What is the stewardship of the parent and what is the agency of the child in the feeding process? How can you make these two work together?</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> At a recent visit to the family pediatrician, Susie was told her son is at risk for childhood obesity. Susie is concerned and would like to do make changes; however, she is concerned about making her son feel bad about his weight. How would you suggest addressing this issue?</li>

<h2>Discussion Board Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will be participating in the discussion board with a group assigned by your instructor. Your instructor will start the threads from here on; <span style="color: #cf2a27;"><strong>please do not start your own new thread.</strong>&nbsp;</span>Rather, you will reply to one of the prompt questions or reply to someone else's post. This keeps the topics grouped together and they are easier to follow.</li>
<li>The discussion board is worth 20 points, and you will need to post more than once to get full points. The grading criteria discussed in the Discussion Board Guidelines will be used. <em><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=61375&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-343128" target="_blank">(Click to go to Discussion Board Guidelines)</a></em>&nbsp;You may see the grading rubric by referring to the rubric table below.</li>
<li>You are only required to post comments on one topic. Your first response should address the depth, breadth or meaning. You do not need to address all three areas. Additional postings may discuss either topic.</li>
<li>To get full credit for timeliness, your first response needs to be posted by <strong>Due Date #1</strong> and your other posts need to allow sufficient time for others to respond (i.e. additional posts should not be posted at the same time as the initial post, but should be posted at least 2 hours prior to the second deadline).</li>
<li>You may continue to participate in the conversation until the discussion board closes at <strong>Due Date #2.</strong></li>
<li><span>Go to the next page to access "L13 Group Discussion Board - Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition" and click "Reply" to begin your post.</span></li>

<td style="width: 712.844px;">Timeliness and posting. Full credit given if first post is made by <strong>Due Date #1</strong>&nbsp;and your other posts allow sufficient time for others to respond (i.e. additional posts should not be posted at the same time as the initial post and should be posted at least 2 hours prior to <strong>Due Date #2</strong>).

<td style="width: 712.844px;">Expanded the depth, breadth, or meaning of the discussion in one of your posts. Full credit means you did an excellent job expanding the discussion and used citations where needed. Remember, just agreeing or restating what someone else has said is not worth points because it did not expand the discussion. You may post as many times as you want but you need at least three posts which expand the discussion for full credit.</td>
