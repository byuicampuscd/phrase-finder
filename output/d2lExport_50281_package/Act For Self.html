<p>As you work through each of the activities below, consider finding answers to the following two statements in preparation for completing the learning assessment:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what ways could applying Principle Four of the Learning Model help solve the challenges found in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Chemistry is a tough class. You come to class each day ready to be taught by the professor who has a Ph.D. You seem to be really struggling to make a good grade. You feel that the professor&rsquo;s style of teaching just doesn&rsquo;t work for you. It is beginning to be frustrating. After all, the professor is a professional teacher. You feel like it is the professor&rsquo;s fault that your grade is sinking.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify and list insights or principles from each learning activity below that can be applied to your own learning and studies as you seek to apply Principle Four of the Learning Model.</li>
</ol>
<p>We invite you to take notes of your insights and impressions as you complete each activity.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1:</strong> Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle Four below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Learning by faith does not come without effort and sacrifice. Teachers and students are expected to act in accordance with their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. These actions include diligent effort and preparation, participation, reflection and prayer, and maintaining a proper attitude toward learning. When learners and teachers exercise agency by acting in accordance with correct principles, they open their hearts to the Holy Ghost and invite His teaching&mdash;thereby accessing the power of the Savior&rsquo;s atonement.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Preach My Gospel</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency&rdquo; (2004, pg. 17).</p>
<p><strong><em>Kim B. Clark</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;To learn by faith, students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come &hellip; in the classroom, where prepared students, exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to teach one another. &hellip; It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Inaugural Response,&rdquo; BYU-Idaho, Oct. 11, 2005)</p>
<p><strong><em>David A. Bednar</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;A learner exercising agency by acting in accordance with correct principles opens his or her heart to the Holy Ghost&mdash;and invites His teaching, testifying power, and confirming witness. Learning by faith requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception. It is in the sincerity and consistency of our faith-inspired action that we indicate to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, our willingness to learn and receive instruction from the Holy Ghost. Thus, learning by faith involves the exercise of moral agency to act upon the assurance of things hoped for and invites the evidence of things not seen from the only true teacher, the Spirit of the Lord. &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning by faith cannot be transferred from an instructor to a student through a lecture, a demonstration, or an experiential exercise; rather, a student must exercise faith and act in order to obtain the knowledge for himself or herself.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Seek Learning by Faith,&rdquo; Address to CES Religious Educators, Feb. 3, 2006, Jordan Institute of Religion)</p>
<strong><em>Marion G. Romney</em></strong> &ldquo;I believe in study. I believe that men learn much through study. As a matter of fact, it has been my observation that they learn little concerning things as they are, as they were, or as they are to come without study. I also believe, however, and know, that learning by study is greatly accelerated by faith&rdquo; ( <em>Learning for the Eternities</em>, 1977, pg. 72). <em> </em><hr style="width: 100%; height: auto; color: #ffffff; border: 1px inset #cccccc;" />
