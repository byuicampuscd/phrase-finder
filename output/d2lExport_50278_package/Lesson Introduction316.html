Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sandbox at nursery school. These are the things I learned. Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Put things back where you found them....Learn some and think some and draw some and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day".</p>
