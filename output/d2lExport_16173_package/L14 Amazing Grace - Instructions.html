                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <h3>Part 1</h3>
                <p>Complete by 11:59 PM Wednesday,&#xA0;see&#xA0;<a href="Schedule.html" target="_self">Calendar</a> for times.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><em>&quot;This generation will be called upon to defend the doctrine of the family as never before. If they don&apos;t know the doctrine, they can&apos;t defend it.&quot; - Sister Julie B. Beck</em></p>
                <p>As mentioned in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16173&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-114424" target="_blank">Conclusion Overview</a>, <strong>you are required</strong> to watch the movie <em>Amazing Grace</em>                    for this final exam. Watching the film and reviewing the semester will be a summative experience of what you personally have taken from this course for you, your posterity, and those children and families that are or will be in your
                    sphere of influence. Although most of this activity will be completed on your own, it will not be fully complete until you share it with another student in the class.</p>
                <p>Prayerfully and thoughtfully review your course materials, readings, Penzu journal entries, and general notes before, during, and after watching the movie. Answer each question thoroughly yet concisely. Use quotes from each of the readings
                    as they pertain to your answer. You will probably have to pause the movie a few times to jot down connections between the class and the movie. Although each answer will vary in length, it is expected that none of the questions will
                    require more than a half-page response.</p>
                <p>Write a paper summarizing your answers and thoughts in bullet-point format (you don&apos;t need to write every word of every thought) that will enable you to expand on it when sharing with a classmate. Your level of effort, thoughtfulness,
                    and connections made between the movie and the course material, as assessed by your instructor and a classmate, will determine your grade.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What doctrine in Wilbur&apos;s heart drove him to advocate? Why is the doctrine of the family so important to have in your heart, to be passionate and persistent?</li>
                    <li>How did Wilbur employ a theoretical (Bronfenbrenner) approach to become a more effective advocate? Identify at least one thing in each system and be specific.</li>
                    <li>How did Wilbur and his fellow advocates do and share their research? What evidence did they provide to persuade those opposing or on the fence?</li>
                    <li>How does the film portray the importance of working together as a group? What has family advocacy group work taught you?</li>
                    <li>What parallels do you see between Wilbur and Captain Moroni in Alma 46? What is a Christian and professional family advocate, and how did Wilbur exemplify that? How can you be effective and Christ-like against such loud and often degrading
                        voices?</li>
                    <li>Marcia Barlow spoke on persuasive speaking and writing. Did Wilbur and others exemplify any of Marcia&apos;s ideas? How so?</li>
                    <li>What role did the government, policy, and religious freedom play in the fight of the Slave Trade? Did you see their political system being pro-family? Why or why not? Answer all questions.</li>
                    <li>Do you feel that Wilbur used his time on earth well? How did you see him showing the elements of consecration that Elder Christofferson spoke of?</li>
                    <li>Any other profound thoughts or personal insights from the movie that are related to child and family advocacy?</li>
                    <li>What was your understanding of the doctrine of the family at the beginning of the semester and how has it changed?</li>
                    <li>Picture your spouse and children (current or future), and write down some thoughts about how they will benefit from you taking this class.</li>

                <p>Your instructor will divide you into pairs. With your assigned partner, coordinate a Google Hangout session where you discuss your responses to the questions provided in the <em>Amazing Grace</em> final exam instructions.</p>
                <p>You may have become accustomed to carrying out your Google Hangout activities in small groups rather than in pairs. However, the purpose of this assignment is to allow you to have a more in-depth, back-and-forth discussion in which you
                    can share and learn in a one-on-one setting. Your interaction should be a true conversation; take turns addressing each question and building on each other&apos;s perspective.</p>
                <p>It is expected that you come to this discussion prepared with enough insights to facilitate a

Assign a member of your group to be in charge of creating your Google Hangout session and posting the link to your recorded video.&#xA0;</p>
                <p>After your group has participated in the discussion, evaluate your partner&apos;s level of preparedness and depth of insight by downloading and completing this <a href="FAML%20460_Conclusion_Amazing%20Grace_Rubric.docx" target="_blank">rubric</a>.</p>
