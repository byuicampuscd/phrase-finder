<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle 1 below.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings" (Lectures on Faith, pg. 3). To exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is to accept Him as our Savior and live in accordance with His will, through repentance and obedience to His commandments. Learning to act in accordance with one's faith in Christ is fundamental to enjoying deep, life-changing learning.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers who center their faith in the Savior "look unto [Him] in every thought." They do not doubt their capacity to learn, nor fear their opportunities to teach (D&amp;C 6:36). The power we access by acting in faith that is focused on the Savior allows us to exceed our natural limits and learn beyond our natural capabilities. This enabling power is manifest through the bestowal of spiritual gifts, accelerated learning, enhancement of natural abilities, discernment, and personal revelation.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<h4>Boyd K. Packer</h4>
<p>"Somewhere in your quest for spiritual knowledge, there is that 'leap of faith,' as the philosophers call it. It is the moment when you have gone to the edge of the light and stepped into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just a footstep or two. 'The spirit of man,' &hellip; as the scripture says, indeed, 'is the candle of the Lord' (Proverbs 20:27)" ("The Candle of the Lord," <em>Ensign</em>, Jan. 1983, pg. 51).</p>
<h4>Kim B. Clark</h4>
<p>"To learn by faith, students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come in a stronger, even more effective Activities program where students lead and teach one another and participate broadly. Some of them will come in the classroom, where prepared students, exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to teach one another. It is precisely in that moment of faith that [the] 'calling up' and 'linking' of personal effort to the Spirit occurs. It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches." ("Inaugural Response," BYU-Idaho, Oct. 11, 2005)</p>
<h4>Henry B. Eyring</h4>
<p>"It is [students'] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His restored gospel and their obedience to His commandments that will put Him at the center of the school. Their faith will largely determine whether we learn here by study and also by faith. As we do, we will attain academic excellence. We will not attain academic excellence without that faith of yours as students and those that follow to learn by study and by faith." (Henry B. Eyring, "A Steady, Upward Course," BYU-Idaho Devotional, September 18, 2001)</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle 2 below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been commanded to receive the Holy Ghost. No matter what subject we study, whether spiritual or temporal, the Holy Ghost may instruct us as to the truths contained therein. Through instruction by the Spirit, our learning can be tailor-made for our personal development. We recognize that as we keep the commandments of God we will receive the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Ghost in all of our learning and teaching.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><strong><em>Gordon B. Hinckley</em></strong></p>
<p>"The Holy Ghost is the Testifier of Truth, who can teach men things that they cannot teach one another." (<em>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</em>, 1997, pg. 259)</p>
<p><strong><em>Joseph Fielding Smith</em></strong></p>
<p>"Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fibre and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten" (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,</em> Vol. 1, edited by Bruce R. McConkie, pg. 48).</p>
<p><strong><em>Spencer W. Kimball</em></strong></p>
<p>"The Holy Ghost is a revelator. Every worthy soul is entitled to a revelation, and it comes through the Holy Ghost. &hellip; He is a reminder and will bring to our remembrance the things which we have learned and which we need in the time thereof. He is an inspirer and will put words in our mouths, enlighten our understandings and direct our thoughts. He is a testifier and will bear record to us of the divinity of the Father and the Son and of their missions and of the program which they have given us. He is a teacher and will increase our knowledge. He is a companion and will walk with us, inspiring us all along the way, guiding our footsteps, impeaching our weaknesses, strengthening our resolves, and revealing to us righteous aims and purposes." (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</em> 23)</p>
<p><strong><em>David A. Bednar</em></strong></p>
<p>Nephi teaches us, "When a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth [the message] unto the hearts of the children of men" (2 Nephi 33:1). Please notice how the power of the Spirit carries the message <em>unto</em> but not necessarily <em>into</em> the heart. A teacher can explain, demonstrate, persuade, and testify, and do so with great spiritual power and effectiveness. Ultimately, however, the content of a message and the witness of the Holy Ghost penetrate into the heart only if a receiver allows them to enter. &hellip;</p>
<p>A learner exercising agency by acting in accordance with correct principles opens his or her heart to the Holy Ghost-and invites His teaching, testifying power, and confirming witness. Learning by faith requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception. It is in the sincerity and consistency of our faith-inspired action that we indicate to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, our willingness to learn and receive instruction from the Holy Ghost. Thus, learning by faith involves the exercise of moral agency to act upon the assurance of things hoped for and invites the evidence of things not seen from the only true teacher, the Spirit of the Lord. ("Seek Learning by Faith," Address to CES Religious Educators, Feb. 3, 2006, Jordan Institute of Religion)</p>
<p><strong><em>Teaching, No Greater Call</em></strong></p>
<p>"As we teach the gospel, we should humbly recognize that the Holy Ghost is the true teacher. Our privilege is to serve as instruments through whom the Holy Ghost can teach, testify, comfort, and inspire. We should therefore become worthy to receive the Spirit." (<em>Teaching, No Greater Call: A Resource Guide for Gospel Teaching,</em> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999, 41)</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle 3 below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Laying hold upon the Word of God in the scriptures and in the words of the prophets signifies our faith in, the priority of, and the importance of the Word of God at BYU-Idaho. The Word of God is the anchor. It is the standard and lens by which all things in every discipline are measured and evaluated. We seek excellence in our academic disciplines as we strive to understand them in the light of the restored gospel. Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho seek to master the learning and knowledge of their respective disciplines, but they do not "lay hold" on that knowledge if it conflicts with the Word of God. When learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho use the Word of God in this way, they are able to "lay hold upon every good thing" (Moroni 7:25).</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><strong><em>Spencer W. Kimball</em></strong></p>
<p>"Many in the secular world are often adrift and anchorless. Only an education which educates for eternity has the wholeness which humans need. When we separate learning from divine moral truth it quickly deteriorates into a restless, roving search for meaning and often drifts into a sensual selfishness" (Edward L. Kimball, <em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</em> 1982, pg. 387).</p>
<p><strong><em>Brigham Young</em></strong></p>
<p>"The philosophy of the heavens and the earth of the worlds that are, that were, and that are yet to come into existence, is all the Gospel that we have embraced. Every true philosopher, so far as he understands the principles of truth, has so much of the Gospel, and so far he is a Latter-day Saint, whether he knows it or not. Our Father, the great God, is the author of the sciences, he is the great mechanic, he is the systematizer of all things, he plans and devises all things, and every particle of knowledge which man has in his possession is the gift of God." (Discourses of Brigham Young, 2 - 3)</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1:</strong> Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle 4 below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Learning by faith does not come without effort and sacrifice. Teachers and students are expected to act in accordance with their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. These actions include diligent effort and preparation, participation, reflection and prayer, and maintaining a proper attitude toward learning. When learners and teachers exercise agency by acting in accordance with correct principles, they open their hearts to the Holy Ghost and invite His teaching&mdash;thereby accessing the power of the Savior&rsquo;s atonement.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Preach My Gospel</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency&rdquo; (2004, pg. 17).</p>
<p><strong><em>Kim B. Clark</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;To learn by faith, students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come &hellip; in the classroom, where prepared students, exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to teach one another. &hellip; It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Inaugural Response,&rdquo; BYU-Idaho, Oct. 11, 2005)</p>
<p><strong><em>David A. Bednar</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;A learner exercising agency by acting in accordance with correct principles opens his or her heart to the Holy Ghost&mdash;and invites His teaching, testifying power, and confirming witness.

Thus, learning by faith involves the exercise of moral agency to act upon the assurance of things hoped for and invites the evidence of things not seen from the only true teacher, the Spirit of the Lord. &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning by faith cannot be transferred from an instructor to a student through a lecture, a demonstration, or an experiential exercise; rather, a student must exercise faith and act in order to obtain the knowledge for himself or herself.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Seek Learning by Faith,&rdquo; Address to CES Religious Educators, Feb. 3, 2006, Jordan Institute of Religion)</p>
<p><strong><em>Marion G. Romney</em></strong> &ldquo;I believe in study. I believe that men learn much through study. As a matter of fact, it has been my observation that they learn little concerning things as they are, as they were, or as they are to come without study. I also believe, however, and know, that learning by study is greatly accelerated by faith&rdquo; ( <em>Learning for the Eternities</em>, 1977, pg. 72). <em> </em></p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle 5 below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Teaching is an essential learning component. At BYU-Idaho, students teach to learn and learn to teach. When students <em>teach diligently,</em> they receive deeper insight and are <em>instructed more perfectly</em> (see D&amp;C 88:78). When learners and teachers view one another charitably, they create safe learning environments where all can stretch and stumble without fear. All learners-students and faculty-serve others through diligent preparation, cooperative effort, and teaching one another; thus charity replaces competition.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><strong><em>Boyd K. Packer</em></strong></p>
<p>"In this life we are constantly confronted with a spirit of competition. Teams contest one against another in an adversary relationship in order that one will be chosen a winner. We come to believe that wherever there is a winner there must also be a loser. To believe that is to be misled. In the eyes of the Lord, everyone may be a winner. Now it is true that we must earn it; but if there is competition in His work, it's not with another soul-it's with our own former selves" (<em>That All May Be Edified</em>, 1982, pg. 84).</p>
<p><strong><em>Robert D. Hales</em></strong></p>
<p>"As I have said, you are at a unique institution. Let me give you a challenge. I would like to give you encouragement to be able to share your gifts and talents so that you can tutor, mentor, be in a study group, or participate in the classroom so that after you leave this institution you will willingly give to others by lifting them and strengthening them. I give you a promise that if you will live your life in such a manner, you will find that both the giver and the receiver will be better off for their interaction." (BYU-Idaho Devotional, Feb. 20, 2007<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Dallin H. Oaks</em></strong></p>
<p>"'Charity is the pure love of Christ' (Moroni 7:47). The Book of Mormon teaches us that this virtue is 'the greatest of all' (Moroni 7:46) &hellip; Our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive" ("Why Do We Serve?" <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1984, pgs. 13 - 14).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Learning Activity #2</strong>: Look up each scripture reference below. Read and ponder the meaning of each scripture and consider what is being taught in relation to Principle 5.</p>
<p>John 13:34 - 35</p>
<p>Matthew 22:36 - 40</p>
<p>D&amp;C 50:22</p>
<p>D&amp;C 88:78, 118</p>
