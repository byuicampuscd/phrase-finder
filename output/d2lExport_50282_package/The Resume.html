<h1>The Resume</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Resume</h2>
<p>There are as many opinions about resumes as there are people: one page or two, chronological or skills, education section first or last, etc.; however, there are some norms in the profession. As you saw in Lesson 2, there are many avenues for employment in this field, but they share a common set of competencies. Because these competencies are associated with skills, a skills based resume will help you present your abilities in the best light to a potential employer.</p>
<p>Even though you probably do not have a long history of progressive experience specific to public health or health education, you do have a great number of experiences that exhibit the use of the skills and competencies of the profession. Remember that you are trying to exhibit your prowess in the seven areas of responsibility discussed in Lesson 2. You will not have seven categories of expertise, but you should have about three that are directly related to a potential job opening. Keep in mind that LDS mission experience, work with the activities program (if you are on campus), fulfilling callings such as positions in Relief Society or the Scouting program, or even the Parent Teacher Organizations for your local schools all require the application of useful skills. Focus on your skills and accomplishments&mdash;not your work duties&mdash;as you begin your resume preparations.</p>
<h3>Skills-based Resume</h3>
<p>A skills-based resume focuses on your capabilities and achievements regardless of where those abilities were garnered. BYU-Idaho has great examples of skills resumes, specifically one for health science, that you can use as a model. Go the Career Services <a href="http://www.byui.edu/career-services/career-preparation-services/resumes" target="_blank">Resume</a> page, scroll down near the end of the document, and read the Skills-based Health Science Functional Resume.</p>
<p>Here are also 3 examples from former BYU-Idaho students who all successfully gained employment right after graduation. Read <a href="Documents%20and%20Images/L04%20Resume%20examples.pdf" target="_blank">their resumes</a>&nbsp;to extend your experience with skills-based resumes. For an alternative version that can be read with a screen reader, click for&nbsp;<a href="Documents%20and%20Images/L3%20Resume%20examples%20new.pdf" target="_blank">resume examples</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning your resume with your education may be the best formatting choice. Most positions require a Bachelor degree as the first employment requirement, so listing it up front helps them know you are minimally qualified. Second, you should list a category called Qualifications with subcategories specific to the position for which you are applying. Some common examples of subcategories are Program Planning, Data Analysis and Evaluation, Leadership and Management, Program Implementation, Community Building, and Group Facilitation.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>As you complete the courses in this program, you will find that the projects and activities you are accomplishing will be easily inserted into your resume. Be sure to keep a running list of the skills you gain as you complete the projects and activities in your courses for the purpose of adding those skills to your resume.</p>
<p>Under each Qualifications subcategory, explain what you accomplished, how you accomplished it, and any related outcomes. You will use action verbs to start each bullet point. Here is a great list of <a href="http://www.byui.edu/Documents/Admin_Offices/Advising/ResumeVerbsBySkill.pdf" target="_blank">useful action verbs</a> to help you express your accomplishments when writing your resume.</p>
<p>As you read earlier, mission, volunteer and church experience are all helpful on your resume as they relate to skills in the workforce. Here are a few examples showing how to convert your typical experiences as a missionary or ward calling into resume items.</p>
<p>Example #1: An LDS mission&mdash;If you trained fellow missionaries (in district meetings and zone conferences) and helped an investigator give up alcohol or tobacco, your resume could say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created and implemented volunteer training and incentive program including group facilitation and educational techniques.</li>
<li>Implemented behavior change contracts and motivational interviewing to help 6 individuals stop smoking (change the number to reflect the number of individuals you actually taught and helped).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example #2: Your church calling&mdash;If you are a teacher, presidency member or otherwise engaged in a calling at church, you have coordinated volunteers, conducted meetings, established lesson plans and implemented those plans, and blessed the lives of people around you. These skills directly translate to the workforce. Your resume could say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directed the monthly volunteer efforts of 55 individuals in largest volunteer women&rsquo;s organization in the world.</li>
<li>Conducted semiannual in service training to motivate and inspire volunteer teachers in spiritual wellness activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>With just a little bit of practice, you can strengthen your resume to highlight your exceptional service to others in terms of marketable skills.</p>
