            <h1>Parenting</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>&quot;To you who are parents, I say, show love to your children. You know you love them, but make certain they know it as well. They are so precious. Let them know. Call upon Heavenly Father for help as you care for their needs each day as
                you deal with challenges which inevitably come with parenthood. You need more than your own wisdom in rearing them.&quot;<br> -President Thomas S. Monson</p>
            <img width="33%" class="right" alt="Happy Family" src="Images/Happy%20Family.jpg" title="Happy Family">
            <p>We addressed some of the challenges of becoming parents but this lesson will focus on some of the challenges and opportunities relative to rearing children within the family. By this time it should be quite apparent to the student of family
                life that there is a wide range of possible parenting behaviors, and that each choice yields differing results. Now you will have an opportunity to explore specific parenting approaches and their likely results.</p>
            <p>We will consider the total effects of parenting, both upon the children and the parents, as well as the subsystems. Though we will not be able to cover the wide range of topics and opportunities relative to parenting we will dive in deeply
                enough to help you develop some parenting skills and perspectives beyond your own upbringing experiences.</p>
            <p>As always, recognizing and committing to utilize wise and well-researched approaches will serve you well, in terms of developing your own family skills and helping others to do so as well.</p>
