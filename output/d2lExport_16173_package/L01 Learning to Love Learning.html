<h1>Learning To Love Learning, Not Grades</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Why We Learn</h2>
<p>Have you ever stopped to consider why we learn? Is it for a grade? A diploma? A job or career? Just to impress others with knowledge and credentials? If any of these are the primary reasons for your learning in college&mdash;and life for that matter&mdash;then you are missing the bigger picture and blessings associated with the real purpose of learning. In this class, you will spend the entire semester reading and engaging in assignments that will hopefully help you learn about child and family advocacy. However, in order for that learning to be long-lasting, powerful, and effective, it is vital for us to first build a strong doctrinal foundation on the process and purpose of learning itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this first week of class, we will focus first and foremost on that learning process. This will help you in the following weeks as we really delve into the content of this class. But let's not limit ourselves to just this class, for there is life and learning beyond not only this class, but mortality as well. Premortal, mortal, and immortal progression is dependent upon our learning. The prophet Joseph Smith put it this way: "a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some evil power in the other world, as evil spirits will have more knowledge, and consequently more power than many men who are on the earth" (History of the Church, 5: 588). Modern-day scripture states that "it is impossible for a man [or woman] to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;C 131), and that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life [or in this class] it will rise with us in the resurrection [or stay with us beyond this course and college]" (D&amp;C 130). The standard procedure of cramming information, regurgitating it on an exam, and then deleting it is a waste of time, money, and mortality. More importantly, it's not really learning, either.</p>
<p>We will start out by reading and considering a couple of articles by Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Before you read these articles, ponder the following questions and then write down some of your thoughts while you read and study. You may consider printing them off and highlighting areas that catch your attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a learner, what are the implications of knowing that I am an&nbsp;<em>agent&mdash;</em>blessed with agency&mdash;who can act, rather than an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;that is merely acted upon?</li>
<li>How will understanding and effectively fulfilling my individual responsibility as a learner prepare me for the world in which I do now and will yet live?</li>
<li>What was most profound or surprising from the articles? Why did this grab at you so much?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Articles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prayerfully read&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/2010/02/learning-to-love-learning?lang=eng" target="_blank">Learning to Love Learning</a></em>, by Elder David A.Bednar.</li>
<li>Prayerfully read&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.lds.org/liahona/2009/04/learning-and-latter-day-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank">Learning and Latter-day Saints</a></em>, by Elder Dallin H. Oaks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How We Learn</h2>
<p>Now that you have taken some time to consider&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we learn, let's focus on&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;learning occurs. Cognitive theories and research findings abound in this area. As a student, you should care about how you learn, because understanding that key notion can unlock your potential, not only in academic learning, but especially in becoming a life-long learner. The short video below shows education reformer Alfie Kohn explaining the research findings on grades vs. learning.</p>

<li>What are some typical things you or other college students do that show you care more about the grade than actually learning?</li>
</ul>
<p>To help cement the idea of how we learn, watch the documentary below. As you watch this, reflect on what Elder Bednar and Elder Oaks have said about learning.</p>

<h2>Course Disclaimer Alert</h2>
<p>Now that you have a much deeper understanding of why and how you truly learn, it would seem rather ridiculous (and hypocritical) if you now expected to get points for every little thing you do in this course. If you were to read, study, post to a discussion board, or complete a journal entry simply for the points, then you would see yourselves only as objects to be acted upon (or coerced) rather than agents who act. So, in this course, points will be used sparingly. You will be expected to be proactive and internally motivated to learn as the following, slightly customized, scripture states:</p>
<p><em>"He [or she] that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise [student]; wherefore he [or she] receiveth no [real learning]. Verily I say, men [and women] should be anxiously engaged in [child and family advocacy], and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness. For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men [and women] do good they shall in nowise lose their [learning and intelligence that leads to change-in themselves and others]"</em>&nbsp;(D&amp;C 58:26-28).</p>
<p>The topics covered in this class are interesting and will be profoundly important to you, your family, and all those you come into contact with. Rather than expecting to be spoon-fed, plan on preparing an appetite and meal, and feed each other.</p>
