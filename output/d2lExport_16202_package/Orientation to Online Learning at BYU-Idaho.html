            <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p style="padding-left: 240px;">(video transcript: <a href="Orientation%20to%20Online%20Learning.html" target="_blank">Word</a>, <a href="http://courses.byui.edu/_GeneralResources/Orientation_transcript.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>)</p>]</span></strong> 
            <p>1) Interaction: This online course follows the BYU-Idaho Learning Model. It includes collaborative learning activities designed to give you the opportunity to teach one another. Most lessons involve interaction with the instructor and with
                other students in both large and small groups.</p>
            <p>2) Due Dates: This semester-based course has assignments due each week, including many lessons with multiple due dates in a week. Assignments cannot typically be turned in after the due date. Students who have not participated in the course
                by the add/drop deadline will be dropped automatically.</p>
            <p>3) Work Load: = 3 hours per credit. The BYU-Idaho standard for the student workload in courses is about 3&#x2013;4 hours per week per credit hour (e.g., a 3&#x2013;credit course would require approximately 9&#x2013;12 hours of work per week).
                Set time aside in your daily schedule to work on the course.</p>
            <p>4) Academic Performance: The same expectations for student performance and outcomes apply for both on-campus and online courses.</p>
            <p>5) A Team Approach to Learning: <br> <i>Course Creators:</i> This online course has been created by a team of BYU-Idaho faculty along with course development specialists.<br> <i>Course Instructor:</i> A certified BYU-Idaho online instructor
                will facilitate the course and work closely with you and your peers. These instructors live across the globe. Their contact information and office hours are posted in the course. Reach out to them with ideas, questions, or concerns you
                have in a course.<br> <i>Support:</i> The BYU-Idaho Online Support Center can help with any issues that may arise for you as an online student.<br> <i>Tutoring:</i> Most online courses have an online tutor.</p>
            <p>6) Feedback: You will have opportunities throughout the course to evaluate the course and instructor. BYU-Idaho welcomes your feedback to improve the online learning experience for future students.</p>
