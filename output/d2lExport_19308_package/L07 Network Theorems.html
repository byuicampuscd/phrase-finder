<h1>NETWORK THEOREMS</h1>
<hr />
<p>Using Kirchhoff's Laws to perform loop analysis or nodal analysis works well to solve circuits that cannot easily be reduced to a series or parallel equivalent circuit. But sometimes, there is an even easier way to do it. Remember, these are all tools for your tool box. An auto mechanic has many types of wrenches, and he selects the most appropriate one for the job he is doing. You, also, should have many "wrenches" in your tool box.</p>
<p>This module will help you learn some other techniques. You have, no doubt, already decided on a favorite Kirchhoff-based method to solve these circuits, but perhaps one of these will work even better sometimes.</p>
<p>Here are some other methods you will learn in this module:</p>
<p><em>Superposition Theorem</em></p>
<p>The general superposition principle allows us to break up a complicated problem into simpler problems and then assemble the answer from its simpler pieces at the end. For electric circuits, it is used to solve the current and voltage for any resistor in a multi-source circuit.</p>
<p>The superposition theorem states that in a linear circuit with several sources, the current and voltage for any element in the circuit is the sum of the currents and voltages produced by each source acting independently. In an electric circuit, a linear element is an electrical element with a linear relationship between current and voltage. Resistors are the most common example of a linear element; other examples include capacitors, inductors, and transformers.</p>
<p>The strategy used in the Superposition Theorem is to eliminate all but one source of power within a network at a time, using series/parallel analysis to determine the currents within the modified network for each power source separately. Then, once the currents have been determined for each power source working separately, the values are all "superimposed" on top of each other (added algebraically) to find the currents (and voltage drops) with all sources active.</p>
<p>Note that the superposition theorem is not applicable to power, since power is not a linear quantity (P = IV = I<sup>2</sup>R = V<sup>2</sup>/R is not a linear relationship between I and V). The total power delivered to a resistive component must be determined using the total current through or the total voltage across the component and cannot be determined by a simple sum of the powers produced by the sources independently.</p>
<p><em>Th&eacute;venin's Theorem</em></p>
<p>The theorem was first discovered by German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1853,but it was not widely published until it was rediscovered in 1883 by French telegraph engineer L&eacute;on Charles Th&eacute;venin. (Th&eacute;venin is usually written simply as Thevenin.) In European countries it is known as the "Helmholtz - Thevenin theorem."</p>
<p>It states that any combination of voltage sources, current sources, and resistors with two terminals connected to a load is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source <em>V</em> and a single series resistor <em>R</em>. The Thevenin equivalent circuit, consisting of an ideal voltage source in series with an ideal resistor, is a simplification technique used in circuit analysis:</p>

<p><em>Norton's Theorem</em></p>
<p>Norton's theorem, an extension of Thevenin's theorem, was introduced in 1926 separately by two people: Siemens &amp; Halske researcher Hans Ferdinand Mayer, and Bell Labs engineer Edward Lawry Norton. Mayer was the only one of the two to actually publish it. Norton published three papers during his lifetime-none of which mention the equivalent circuit that's associated with his name. In Europe, Norton's theorem is known as the "Mayer - Norton theorem".</p>
<p>The theorem states that any collection of voltage sources, current sources, and resistors with two terminals connected to a load is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source, <em>I</em>, in parallel with a single resistor, <em>R</em>. The Norton equivalent circuit, consisting of an ideal current source in parallel with an ideal resistor, is another simplification technique used in circuit analysis:</p>
