<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To complete Principle One requirements, follow the instructions for each learning activity listed below and then complete the learning assessment at the end. <strong>Before you can open the assessment at the bottom of the page, you&rsquo;ll be asked if you have completed each learning activity as instructed.</strong></p>
<p>As you work through each of the activities below, consider finding answers to the following two statements in preparation for completing the learning assessment:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what ways could applying Principle One of the Learning Model help solve the challenges found in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>You are taking an economics class that seems too hard to understand. You struggle to grasp some of the concepts and numbers. This lack of knowledge is embarrassing to you. You do not want your classmates or friends to know that you are quickly falling behind so you decide not to ask questions in class and to just figure things out on your own.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Identify and list insights or principles from each learning activity below that can be applied to your own learning and studies as you seek to apply Principle One of the Learning Model.</li>
</ol>
<p>We invite you to take notes of your insights and impressions as you complete each activity.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle One below.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings" (Lectures on Faith, pg. 3). To exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is to accept Him as our Savior and live in accordance with His will, through repentance and obedience to His commandments. Learning to act in accordance with one's faith in Christ is fundamental to enjoying deep, life-changing learning.</p>
<p>Learners and teachers who center their faith in the Savior "look unto [Him] in every thought." They do not doubt their capacity to learn, nor fear their opportunities to teach (D&amp;C 6:36). The power we access by acting in faith that is focused on the Savior allows us to exceed our natural limits and learn beyond our natural capabilities. This enabling power is manifest through the bestowal of spiritual gifts, accelerated learning, enhancement of natural abilities, discernment, and personal revelation.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<h4>Boyd K. Packer</h4>
<p>"Somewhere in your quest for spiritual knowledge, there is that 'leap of faith,' as the philosophers call it. It is the moment when you have gone to the edge of the light and stepped into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just a footstep or two. 'The spirit of man,' &hellip; as the scripture says, indeed, 'is the candle of the Lord' (Proverbs 20:27)" ("The Candle of the Lord," <em>Ensign</em>, Jan. 1983, pg. 51).</p>
<h4>Kim B. Clark</h4>
<p>"To learn by faith, students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come in a stronger, even more effective Activities program where students lead and teach one another and participate broadly. Some of them will come in the classroom, where prepared students, exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to teach one another. It is precisely in that moment of faith that [the] 'calling up' and 'linking' of personal effort to the Spirit occurs. It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches." ("Inaugural Response," BYU-Idaho, Oct. 11, 2005)</p>
<h4>Henry B. Eyring</h4>
<p>"It is [students'] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His restored gospel and their obedience to His commandments that will put Him at the center of the school. Their faith will largely determine whether we learn here by study and also by faith. As we do, we will attain academic excellence. We will not attain academic excellence without that faith of yours as students and those that follow to learn by study and by faith." (Henry B. Eyring, "A Steady, Upward Course," BYU-Idaho Devotional, September 18, 2001)</p>
