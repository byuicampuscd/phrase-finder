<h1><span>FAMILY HISTORY CLASSES AT BYU-IDAHO</span><span><br /></span></h1>
<hr />
<p>Welcome to the Family History program! We're excited to have you as part of the program. Whether you have chosen to enroll in these courses for personal development or to pursue a career as a professional genealogist, please be aware that these are university level courses. As such, you will be expected to complete college level work and fulfill all course requirements. On average, students spend 3-4 hours per week per credit to successfully complete their course requirements. Most courses in this program are 3-credit courses and will necessitate 9-12 hours of your time each week. In the time you dedicate to your studies, you will develop invaluable genealogical skills.</p>
<div><span>There are three areas of learning that you need to be aware of as you take FHGEN courses.Take time to familiarize yourself with The Spirit of Ricks, the BYU-I Learning Model, and the FHGEN technical requirements.</span></div>

<h2><span>THE BYU-I LEARNING MODEL<br /></span></h2>
<p><span>The Learning Model was created to deepen the learning experiences of students at BYU-Idaho. The Learning Model enables students to take greater responsibility for their own learning and for teaching one another. The model is structured around three process steps and five principles, which will be explained in the following links.</span></p>
