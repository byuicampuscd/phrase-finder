<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Get to know each other! This activity will help you become acquainted with those who are gathering with you in this class so it will be more comfortable to collaborate throughout this course.</p>
<p>Introduce yourself in a few short paragraphs (100&ndash;150 words) by starting a new discussion thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;New Thread&rdquo; button in the upper left hand corner of this box.</li>
<li>Use the first 50 characters to give your introduction a title and then start your post on the next line.</li>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li>Post a &ldquo;headshot&rdquo; picture to identify yourself in the class. Follow this link for <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">directions</a>&nbsp;for posting pictures. Also, in your thread, post a picture of yourself doing something that you like or something that shows more about you and your interests (i.e. hobby, family, sports, music, reading, or other). Again, please observe the Dress and Grooming Standards and keep it classroom appropriate.</li>]</span></strong> 
<ul>
<li>Remember that this picture is the image your instructor and classmates will see to identify you for the entire semester. Remember that first impressions last a long time.</li>
<li>Post a headshot picture of yourself. Please do not post a picture of your wife, your dog, a tree, you and your spouse together, etc. The instructor wants to see you! (You can post other pictures in the actual message that you post.)</li>
<li>Ensure that your headshot picture follows the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a>&nbsp;in the BYU&ndash;Idaho Honor Code. This includes everything from appropriate dress, countenance, and poses. Although you are not taking this class on campus, the same standards must be observed off-campus. Inappropriate and distracting faces and gestures may not be used.</li>
</ul>
<li>After you have posted your own information, read at least four to six of your classmates&rsquo; postings. Respond to at least three with whom you have something in common. You might explain the connection (perhaps you lived in the same area, served in the same mission, share hobbies, etc.), or you might have a question about something they said. Respond sincerely (50&ndash;75 words). Use this activity to get to know and connect with your classmates.</li>
</ul>
