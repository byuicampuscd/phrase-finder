<h4>Case Study B</h4>
<p>Ron is a 61 yo M. Ron has had severe abdominal cramping and diarrhea for 4 days.

<h4>Case Study E</h4>
<p>Tiffany, a 4 yo F, presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother is frantic. She states Tiffany &ldquo;can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo; While the physician attends to Tiffany, the nurse collects Tiffany&rsquo;s history from her mother. Tiffany has had some vomiting and diarrhea for two days that Mom attributed to the flu. Yesterday she noticed Tiffany was falling over and had difficulty maintaining her balance.&nbsp;The very alert nurse asked Mom about ingestion of home-canned items. Tiffany's mother reports she cans frequently and a large part of the family&rsquo;s diet is home canned food. After the initial work-up and brief discussion with her nurse, Tiffany was started on oxygen, a IV was started and the doctor calls the ambulance.</p>
<h4>Case Study F</h4>

It is warm to the touch and the entire finger is inflamed. Upon closer examination there is a purulent discharge from the lesion.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Case Study J</h4>
<p>Matt is your 4 yo M neighbor. He loves to play with your son, Brandon. One day Matt comes over to your house to play Legos with Brandon. However, you notice Matt has a rash on his face and arms. You look closely and notice lesions in multiple stages. Some are red spots, others are vesicles (fluid-filled), and others are scabs (crusts). You say to Matt, &ldquo;It looks like you have a rash.&rdquo; He responds, &ldquo;Yeah, I got them from Tom [his brother], and they itch like crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Case Study K</h4>
<p>You and your spouse are in church on Sunday. You are excited because this will be Katie&rsquo;s (your daughter) first day to go to nursery. When you get to the nursery you see Sister Smith&rsquo;s child, Will. He looks different than normal. You look closely and Will has bright red cheeks, and a rash on his arms. You ask Sister Smith about Will and she says, &ldquo;That has just come on recently. Sometimes he gets a fever, sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t. I think he is just sensitive to heat, because I have to take his church sweater off every Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Case Study L</h4>
<p>Lilly is a 4 yo F. She is being raised by her grandmother. Her mother is in prison and her father has never been a part of her life. Lilly has developed a severe cough.

<h4>Case Study M</h4>
<p>You are part of the Doctors Without Borders organization serving an underserved population in the former Soviet Union. A 3 yo M, Vladimir, is brought to your clinic. Through an interpreter you gather the patient suffers from a fever, sore throat, rasping cough and loss of voice. Upon examination you see a very characteristic thick, patchy, grayish mucus membrane. This pseudomembrane causes airway restriction causing the patient difficulty breathing.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Case Study N</h4>
<p>5 year-old Pam is brought to the ER. She is accompanied by her mother. Pam&rsquo;s mother tells you Pam has a unhealed wound on her leg. She said this happened when she rolled over onto a tooth-pick that was hidden in the carpet. Mother said she removed the object, and has been watching the area. Now the lesion has surrounding rigidity, Pam is having painful involuntary contractions, and &ldquo;her stomach is hard as a rock.&rdquo; &nbsp;Upon further examination you notice Pam&rsquo;s altered voice due to contracted facial muscles. When asked, Mom says she does not know if she has ever had immunizations.</p>
