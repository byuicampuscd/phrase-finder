<h1>Introduction to FDREL 122</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Welcome to Book of Mormon 2: Alma 30 - Moroni</h2>
<p>Below are explanations of the activities for each week. You will find a similar page at the beginning of every lesson telling you what activities to <g class="gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="43" data-gr-id="43">complete,</g> when they are due, and an approximation of the time it will take to complete each <g class="gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="42" data-gr-id="42">one-although</g> you may find you need a little more (or less) time on some of them. The Learn activities are generally due first; they will prepare you for the rest of the lesson's activities and assessments. Plan ahead so that you can finish everything before it is due. You can navigate to the different activities either by clicking on the activity in the <g class="gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="45" data-gr-id="45">left hand</g> menu or using the links provided on the Overview pages. In either case, make sure you understand what is expected each week, and when, so that you can get the most from the course.</p>
<p>As you work on assignments, be proactive by thinking about how your efforts can help you to <em>learn, do,</em> and <em>become</em> a better disciple of Jesus Christ. Below is a list of Learn, Do and Become activities you will participate in throughout the course, along with a description of the activity.</p>
