            <h1>L11: AE - Application Exercise: Challenging the System</h1>
            <p><strong>Due&#xA0;End of Week&#xA0;</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <p>In this assignment, you have the opportunity to &quot;challenge the system&quot; in some way.</p>
            <p>In the previous lesson you were assigned to watch some clips from the movie <em>The Sound of Music</em>. In the Von Trapp Family System, challenging the rules is unacceptable. &#xA0;Maria gives us a good example of&#xA0;&quot;challenging the
                system&quot; as she confronts the father&apos;s rigid rules in the <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<a href="http://stream.byui.edu/VideoPlayer/BYUIplayer.html?StartCue=4277&amp;EndCue=4764&amp;VideoName=1306_dvd&amp;VideoType=libraryvideos" target="_blank" title="second clip">second clip</a>]</span></strong> .&#xA0;We
                also see her challenging the system in the <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<a href="http://stream.byui.edu/VideoPlayer/BYUIplayer.html?StartCue=1406&amp;EndCue=1947&amp;VideoName=1306_dvd&amp;VideoType=libraryvideos" target="_blank">first clip</a><span>&#xA0;when she asked</span>]</span></strong> &#xA0;the
                Captain what is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> whistle signal.&#xA0;</p>
            <p>Salvador Minuchin, the noted Family Systems therapist, wrote that challenging the system &quot;suggests a search for new patterns &#x2026; The old order must be undermined, to allow for the formation of the new.&quot; (Minuchin, 1981, Family
                Therapy Techniques, p. 67).&#xA0;</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Find some way to challenge an existing system (pattern) in your family or&#xA0;among your friends. Observe what happens.&#xA0;</p>
            <p>Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let&apos;s say my family has a pattern of not showing emotion or saying &quot;I love you&quot;. I could go home and give my dad a big hug and say &quot;I love you.&quot; Then I could do the same to my other family members and see how the
                    family responds. Do they try and shut it down with negative feedback loops?</li>
                <li>Another example could be challenging the system by sitting in someone&apos;s place at the dinner table OR</li>
                <li>kindly confronting a roommate who is consistently breaking curfew (the system being that usually everyone &#xA0;no one says anything).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Write a paper between 100 - 350 words addressing these questions. <strong>Each question should be a heading in your paper.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What was the &quot;system&quot; (pattern) before you challenged it?</li>
                <li>What did you do?</li>
                <li>How did the system respond?</li>
                <li>Do you feel the system needs to be challenged?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Save a copy of your work to your computer.</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Go to the next page to access &quot;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16180&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-116116" target="_blank" title="L11: AE - Application Exercise">L11: AE - Application Exercise</a>&quot;
                and paste the contents of your paper&#xA0;into the comment box.</p>
            <p>&#xA0;Please include the word count at the bottom of your paper.</p>
