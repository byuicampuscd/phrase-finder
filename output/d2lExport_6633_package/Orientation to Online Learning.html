<h6>Interaction</h6>
<p>This online course follows the BYU-Idaho Learning Model. It includes collaborative learning activities designed to give you the opportunity to teach one another. Most lessons involve interaction with the instructor and with other students in both large and small groups.</p>
<h6>Due Dates</h6>
<p>This semester-based course has assignments due each week, including many lessons with multiple due dates in a week. Assignments cannot typically be turned in after the due date. Students who have not participated in the course by the add/drop deadline will be dropped automatically.</p>
<h6>Work Load</h6>
<p>The work load is 3 hours per credit. The BYU-Idaho standard for the student workload in courses is about 3-4 hours per week per credit hour (e.g., a 3&ndash;credit course would require approximately 9&ndash;12 hours of work per week). Set time aside in your daily schedule to work on the course.</p>
