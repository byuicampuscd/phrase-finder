<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Principle Five of the <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/LearningModel/src/default.htm" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a> states that, &ldquo;Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho love, serve, and teach one another.&rdquo; Before you can love, serve, and teach one another effectively, you need to know one another. On this discussion board, you will introduce yourself to your classmates and instructor, get to know your classmates, and share your thoughts regarding the talks you read from the L01 Readings&nbsp;assignment.&nbsp;This discussion board is also an opportunity to learn how to use a Google Hangout on Air (HOA).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>If you are new to online learning at BYU-Idaho, read this <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/ats/tutorials/brainhoney/syllabus/post_reply_ss.pdf" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to learn how to use a discussion board. Also be aware that in order to post on any discussion board in this course, your computer&rsquo;s language must be set to English for the United States. If you need assistance to change your computer&rsquo;s language use your computer&rsquo;s help features, search the internet, or contact <a href="http://www.byui.edu/online/online-support-center" target="_blank">Help</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p>Spend a few moments to tell your classmates about yourself by sharing a personal video introduction. Also include your thoughts regarding the L01 Relevance&nbsp;activity. Your initial post should be completed by Thursday and must include the following:</p>
<ol>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li>When meeting a new person, it is always nice to see a face to accompany a name. This is also true when meeting your online classmates. Upload a profile photo by following <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.</li>]</span></strong> 
<li>Follow the steps in the <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/7931ca5d-1b7b-4773-965a-7880c55338a2/1/HoA.zip/story.html" target="_blank">HOA Tutorial</a>&nbsp;module to set up your Google+ and YouTube accounts.</li>
<li>Using the instructions in the HOA tutorial listed above, use an HOA to record your introduction.
<ul>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> Because you aren&rsquo;t inviting anyone else to join your HOA, you must remove the &ldquo;Public&rdquo; option from the &ldquo;Audience&rdquo; section and replace it with your own Gmail address in order to start the HOA.</li>
<li>Wait for the HOA to load. Then click &ldquo;Start broadcast.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Introduce yourself by talking about your hobbies and interests; your family; your favorite locations and foods; the types of books, movies, or music you like; and what type of career you currently have or hope to have in the future.</li>
<li>Next, explain what you learned about yourself from the L01 Relevance&nbsp;activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop the recording. Use the instructions in the HOA tutorial above to retrieve a link to your video from your YouTube channel. (It may take a few minutes to appear in your account. Be sure to update the settings on your video so that those who use the link can view it.)</li>
<li>Go to the next page to access "L01 Icebreaker" and click &ldquo;Start a New Thread&rdquo; to begin your post. Title your post, and then add the link to your video in the comment box.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Watch at least 4&ndash;6 of your classmates&rsquo; posts in a sincere effort to get to know them. Reply to at least two of your classmates by stating what you have in common, contrast your experiences, ask him or her a question, or respond to their comments about their Out of the Box activity.</p>
<p>You are welcome to respond to more than two of your classmates as you strive to get to know one another. You may choose to respond by typing text or by creating another video. Post your responses by Saturday.</p>
