<h4>Case Study A</h4>
<p>Troy, a 9-month-old infant, is brought to your clinic by his mother. She tells you that she has noticed that Troy doesn&rsquo;t try to crawl, but mainly uses his hands to pull himself around. She finds this unusual because her other children had started crawling by this age. You question the mother about her health during pregnancy and she admits that she had diabetes during the pregnancy.</p>
<h4>Case Study B</h4>
<p>Dylan and David, twin infants, are brought to your clinic by their mother. The mother tells you that both boys are having difficulty eating and when she feeds them the formula comes out their noses. Upon physical examination, you find that Dylan has a cleft in his upper lip and David has a hole in the top of his mouth.</p>
<h4>Case Study C</h4>
<p>Cynthia, a 2-month-old infant, is brought to your clinic by her mother. She tells you that Cynthia has been having trouble eating. As you examine Cynthia, you first notice her skin has a blueish hue and frothy white bubbles in her mouth. You order an X-ray to be done and find that Cynthia&rsquo;s esophagus has not formed completely.</p>

<h4>Case Study F</h4>
<p>Alex, a 2-day-old infant, is brought to your clinic by her mother. She is worried because Alex still hasn&rsquo;t had a bowel movement. As you examine Alex, you find that his abdomen is swollen. Upon further examination it also appears Alex has some evidence of Down Syndrome.</p>
