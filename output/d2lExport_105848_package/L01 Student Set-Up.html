<div class="drop-down writing">How to Succeed in This Course</div>
<div class="drop-content">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Read the following tips on how to succeed in this course. This assignment will not be submitted.</p>
<p>There are three basic things you must do to succeed in this course:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do the work.</li>
<li>Stay on schedule.</li>
<li>Follow the Honor Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do these three things, you will not only get a passing grade for the course, but you will have an excellent educational experience. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<h3>Do the Work</h3>
<p>This is a rigorous course. To get a passing grade, you will have to put forth a good deal of effort to complete all of the assignments. When you see a time estimate next to a learning activity, that is the approximate amount of time it will take <strong>if</strong> you are focused on the assignment and <strong>if</strong> you are not allowing yourself to be distracted by other things. You will have a very difficult time completing these assignments if you do them at the same time you watch TV, cook food, talk with your roommates or family members, and send text messages to your friends every three minutes. You must set aside sufficient time to do the work throughout the week (you can&rsquo;t do it all in one night!). And, you must find a place to do the work where you will not be distracted by anything (you can&rsquo;t get it done with a cell phone call interrupting you every few minutes!). Then, you must commit to focus your attention on the work and do your very best to complete it in the amount of time you have scheduled. If you do this, you will learn more in less time, and you will find the work to be much more pleasurable.</p>
<h3>Stay on Schedule</h3>
<p>Once you have set up a regular study schedule, keep it. One of the biggest problems that students have with their courses is that they procrastinate doing the work. They put it off until they have so much work to do that they cannot figure out a way to get it all done before the due date arrives. In this course, you cannot do this and still expect to receive a passing grade. There are assignments that must be completed by specific days and times every week. If you put off doing the work until just before an assignment is due, you will find it much more difficult to concentrate on getting the work done. To succeed in this class, you will have to follow your regular study schedule every week to ensure that you do your best work and that it gets done on time.</p>
<h3>Follow the Honor Code</h3>
<p>Although there are several types of group learning activities in every lesson, this course requires a lot of individual study and work. In particular, most assignments involving a study guide and quiz are meant to be learning activities you complete on your own. If you decide to work with others to try and find all the quiz answers without having to do all the assigned work, you are not only cheating yourself out of an education, you are cheating your way to a failing grade. There are other assignments throughout the course that will require you to recall information or use skills that you should have developed as you completed the learning activities. If you don&rsquo;t do the work, and you try to cheat your way to higher quiz grades, you will hinder your ability to complete these other assignments. Most likely, you will fail those assignments. So, do yourself and others a favor&mdash;do not cheat on any assignments, no matter how tempting it might be. Instead, renew your commitment to follow the BYU-Idaho Honor Code, double your efforts to do the work, and follow your study schedule.</p>
<h3>Plan For Success</h3>
<p>Clearly, if you want to succeed in this course, you need to figure out how you will do the work and how you will stay on schedule. Doing this will help you avoid situations in which you might be tempted to violate the Honor Code and cheat. Such situations can arise quicker in the semester than you might think. So, it is important for you to start making a plan for success right away.</p>

<div class="drop-down writing">Prepare to Meet with Your Instructor&nbsp;for Office Hours</div>
<div class="drop-content">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Traditionally, instructors have held online meetings called &ldquo;Office Hours&rdquo; to provide students with an opportunity to ask questions about the course content and discuss housekeeping issues. For this course, you may interact with the instructor live in an online Office Hours meeting. You are not required to attend the Office Hours meeting, but you are encouraged to take advantage of the Office Hours whenever possible. Check each week&rsquo;s Notes from Instructor page to get information on the times you may attend Office Hours. Follow the instructor&rsquo;s directions to actively participate in the live Office Hours meeting.</p>
<p>Be prepared to&nbsp;participate in the live Office Hours meetings by following the steps listed below (before your first meeting):</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the &ldquo;My Instructor&rdquo; folder in the course main menu (on the left side of the screen).</li>
<li>Select the Instructor Profile, and click the link next to the Virtual Office.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Enter as a guest&rdquo; by typing in your first and last name.</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Enter Room&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>In the main menu (in the upper left of the page), select Meeting&gt;Manage My Settings &gt; Audio Setup Wizard.</li>
<li>Follow the directions in the Audio Setup Wizard to make sure that your microphone is working correctly. You will use this microphone and your earphones during the first online meeting to talk with other students. (The rule is that you cannot use the microphone to talk unless you are wearing your earphones.) You need to go through the Audio Wizard now so you will be ready to fully participate in the first online meeting.</li>
<li>You may want to spend time practicing with the chat tool and hand-raising (status) tool just to see how they work.<span>&nbsp;As a general rule, you may type text in the chat box at any time, but you should &ldquo;raise your hand&rdquo; first before you use the microphone (If too many people try to talk at once, you will hear some very unpleasant feedback noise!). The instructor will let you know when it is your turn to speak.</span></li>
<li>When you have finished exploring the online meeting tool, you can exit the meeting by selecting Meeting&gt;Exit Connect Pro. You will also exit the meeting automatically if you close your browser.</li>

<div class="drop-down writing">How to Understand Due Dates</div>
<div class="drop-content">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>In BYU-Idaho online courses you have the unique opportunity to associate with classmates from all over the world and across many&nbsp;time zones. This presents the unique challenge of establishing due dates that work for everyone, allow you to use as much of the weekend as possible to study, and not interfere with Sabbath Day observance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the due dates for this course are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Due Date 01:&nbsp;</strong>Tuesday, 11:00 PM <span>Mountain Standard Time (MST)</span></li>
<li><strong>Due Date 02:&nbsp;</strong><span>Thursday, 11:00 PM&nbsp;</span>MST</li>
<li><strong>Due Date 03:</strong>&nbsp;<span>Saturday, 11:00 PM MST</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that Rexburg, Idaho is Mountain Standard Time. The exact time that assignments are due for you will depend on&nbsp;your timezone. For example:</p>
<p><img src="/content/enforced/64044-Design/world%20map.jpg" alt="world map showing what time it is in different time zones" title="world map showing what time it is in different time zones" width="100%" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>The above graphic is correct in January of each year. Be aware that time zone differences may fluctuate during the semester due to the effects of Daylight Savings changes which occur in some countries.</em></p>
<h2>Update Your Settings</h2>
<p>The Course Schedule and Calendar features in I-Learn 3.0 convert Rexburg, Idaho due dates/times (Mountain Standard Time) to the correct deadline for your location ONLY IF you update your settings. Update your settings by following the instructions in the "<a href="http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/54703/l/507909-how-do-i-set-my-timezone" target="_blank">How Do I Set My Timezone?</a>" tutorial.</p>
<h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask you instructor questions as early as possible to allow sufficient response time. Like you, your instructor is not expected to work on the Sabbath. Plan for a delayed response if you contact your instructor near the Sabbath, as your instructor&rsquo;s time zone may differ from yours.</li>
<li>If you need to coordinate schedules with classmates to complete group activities, you may want&nbsp;to search the internet for a time zone calculator to determine time differences. Please remember to be flexible and sensitive to the needs of all group members.</li>
<li>There is a monthly I-Learn update which typically occurs on the second Saturday of each month from 11:00 PM - 5:00 AM Mountain Time. I-Learn will be inaccessible during that time.</li>
<li>Be aware of the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/online/online-support-center" target="_blank">Online Support Center</a> hours in case you need other assistance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="drop-down writing">Join a Group</div>

<p>You will need to join a discussion group that you will remain with throughout the semester.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start by clicking on the &ldquo;More Tools&rdquo; drop-down list, found on the top right corner of this page.</li>
<li>Click on &ldquo;Groups.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Click on the blue "View Available Groups" button near the top of the page.</li>
<li>From here, you will see a list of countries appear. DO NOT JOIN a country group at this time. This is for an activity later in the semester. Instead, scroll down until you see a header titled, <strong>"Google HOA Sign-up."&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Choose a group based on&nbsp;a meeting time that works best for you. Remember, all times shown are Mountain standard time (Rexburg, Idaho &nbsp;time).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once you have located the group you wish to join, click the corresponding "Join Group" link, on the right.</li>
<ol>
<li>Once you have joined a group, it will appear in the "My Groups" section of your Groups view from Step 2.</li>

<li>Hints:</li>
<ol>
<li>If you wish to see the names of the other people that have already joined a group, click the link in the "Members"&nbsp;column.</li>
<li>These self-enroll groups allow a limited number of group members to join. Once a group is full, the "Join Group" link will disappear.</li>
<li>Choose a group that works with your preferred meeting time. You will work with this&nbsp;group&nbsp;for the rest of the semester. Plan to meet with your&nbsp;group for your group meetings next week, held via&nbsp;Google Hangouts on Air.</li>
