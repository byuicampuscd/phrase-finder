<div class="drop-down">PART 1: COVER LETTER</div>
<div class="drop-content">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><strong><em>Before&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>you begin this assignment, read/view all items in the "</strong><strong><a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=101384&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-149389" target="_blank">Unit 1 Presentation &amp; Materials</a></strong><strong>"&nbsp;page. For this assignment, you will be evaluated on your adherence to principles taught in the materials provided there.</strong></p>
<p>This assignment is the first of three documents that you will produce as part of an employment packet. You will also create a r&eacute;sum&eacute; and a LinkedIn page. (See the&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=101384&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-151459" target="_blank">Unit 1 Overview</a>.)</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to practice writing for an audience to showcase your experiences and qualifications for a position.</p>
<p>A cover letter should entice the reader to interview you. As such, this is a persuasive document where you &ldquo;sell yourself.&rdquo; Most successful cover letters include an opening paragraph where the writer states the position he or she is applying for and perhaps how the candidate heard about the job. This paragraph may also briefly identify why you are a strong candidate.</p>
<p>The next one or two paragraphs should link your education and experience to the specific qualifications for the position. Conclude with a paragraph that ties the letter together and explains how the reader can contact you.</p>
<p>Download the attached <a href="/content/enforced/101384-Online.2016.Spring.B220.CCC/Course Files/Unit%201%20Writing%20Assigment%20Template.doc" target="_blank">Word document</a>&nbsp;and write your letter in the document. It contains a grading rubric table that your instructor will use later to evaluate your work. Do not edit or delete the table. Your document should be patterned after this&nbsp;<a href="/content/enforced/101384-Online.2016.Spring.B220.CCC/Course Files/Email%20Format%20.docx" target="_blank">format example</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>File Naming Protocol</strong></h5>
<p>This is the pattern you must follow in naming this file or your work will not be graded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Last name_First name_Assignment Name.doc (or .docx)</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Jones_Tom_Cover Letter.doc (or .docx)</li>
</ul>

For this assignment, you will be evaluated on your adherence to principles taught in the materials provided there.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to practice writing a summary of your experiences and qualifications for a specific position. You should choose a position that you can imagine yourself applying for, such as an internship or job upon graduation. Use your current experience and knowledge to showcase how you are a good fit for the job. In other words, do not invent skills or experiences you do not already have.</p>
<p>Arrange your r&eacute;sum&eacute; either chronologically or functionally. Include education information (including key courses and honors, if any), experience, and activities/recognitions/interests. Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; should be no longer than one page and must fit the requirements of your field.</p>
