<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Before beginning this assignment, view the&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=50279&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-337731" target="_blank">Tagul Tutorial</a>&nbsp;located in the Tutorial Library under Module 01.</p>
<p>Get to know each other! This activity will help you become acquainted with those who are gathering with you in this class so it will be more comfortable to collaborate throughout this course. Introduce yourself in a few short paragraphs (100 - 150 words) to the class by starting a new discussion thread.</p>
<p>Please also make sure you have uploaded a profile picture&nbsp;to identify yourself in the class.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<li><a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">Follow this link for profile picture directions</a></li>]</span></strong> 
<li>Remember that this picture is the image your instructor and classmates will see to identify you for the entire semester. Remember that first impressions last a long time.</li>
<li>Please make sure the photo is a close-up picture of your face.</li>
<li>Please do not post a picture of your spouse, your dog, a tree, or you and your spouse together. The instructor wants to see you! (You can post other pictures in the actual message that you post. See the bullet below.)</li>
<li>Ensure that your picture follows the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a>&nbsp;in the BYU-Idaho Honor Code. This includes everything from appropriate dress, countenance, and poses. Although you are not taking this class on campus, the same standards must be observed off-campus. Inappropriate and distracting faces and gestures may not be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To Begin</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the next page to access "W01.03 Discussion Board: Icebreaker" and click &ldquo;Start a New Thread&rdquo; to begin your post.</span></li>
<li>Use the first 50 characters to give your introduction a title and then start your post on the next line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post a picture of yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>In your thread, post a picture of yourself doing something that you like or something that shows more about you (i.e. hobby, family, sports, music, reading, or other). This is how you can show more about you and your interests. Again, please observe the Dress and Grooming Standards and keep it classroom appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Word cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will create a word cloud on Tagul.com expressing your desire to become a teacher. Watch the video tutorial on how to create your own word cloud on tagul.com and post your finished product as part of this post.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After posting your word cloud, explain your desire to become a teacher and how your word cloud reflects that (100-150 words).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Read and comment on others' posts</h3>
<ul>
<li>After you have posted your own information, read four to six of your classmates' posts. Respond to at least three with whom you have something in common. You might explain the connection (perhaps you lived in the same area, served in the same mission, share hobbies, share the same reasons for going into eduction etc.) or you might have a question about something they said. Respond sincerely (50-75 words). A major theme of the Doctrine and Covenants is gathering to build Zion. Use this activity to really begin to get to know and connect with your classmates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Early posts are likely to get more traffic. Try to reply to posts with fewer responses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
