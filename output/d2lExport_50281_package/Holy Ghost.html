<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To complete Principle Two requirements, follow the instructions for each learning activity listed below as indicated by the arrows and then complete the learning assessment at the end. <strong>Before you can open the assessment at the bottom of the page, you'll be asked if you have completed each learning activity as instructed. </strong></p>
<p>As you work through each of the activities below, consider finding answers to the following two statements in preparation for completing the learning assessment:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what ways could applying Principle Two of the Learning Model help solve the challenges found in this scenario?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>You are in your first semester at BYU-Idaho. You want to eventually get into the nursing program. In the first pre-nursing class (BIO 101), your professor told the class that it is important to invite the Holy Ghost to the class each day. You trust the professor, but are not sure what difference it will make. After all, you have made it this far without "inviting" the Holy Ghost in all of your studies.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Identify and list insights or principles from each learning activity below that can be applied to your own learning and studies as you seek to apply Principle Two of the Learning Model.</li>
</ol>
<p>We invite you to take notes of your insights and impressions as you complete each activity.</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Activity #1</strong>: Read the introductory content and associated quotes for Principle Two below.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been commanded to receive the Holy Ghost. No matter what subject we study, whether spiritual or temporal, the Holy Ghost may instruct us as to the truths contained therein. Through instruction by the Spirit, our learning can be tailor-made for our personal development. We recognize that as we keep the commandments of God we will receive the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Ghost in all of our learning and teaching.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><strong><em>Gordon B. Hinckley</em></strong></p>
<p>"The Holy Ghost is the Testifier of Truth, who can teach men things that they cannot teach one another." (<em>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</em>, 1997, pg. 259)</p>
<p><strong><em>Joseph Fielding Smith</em></strong></p>
<p>"Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fibre and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten" (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,</em> Vol. 1, edited by Bruce R. McConkie, pg. 48).</p>
<p><strong><em>Spencer W. Kimball</em></strong></p>
<p>"The Holy Ghost is a revelator. Every worthy soul is entitled to a revelation, and it comes through the Holy Ghost. &hellip; He is a reminder and will bring to our remembrance the things which we have learned and which we need in the time thereof. He is an inspirer and will put words in our mouths, enlighten our understandings and direct our thoughts. He is a testifier and will bear record to us of the divinity of the Father and the Son and of their missions and of the program which they have given us. He is a teacher and will increase our knowledge. He is a companion and will walk with us, inspiring us all along the way, guiding our footsteps, impeaching our weaknesses, strengthening our resolves, and revealing to us righteous aims and purposes." (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</em> 23)</p>
<p><strong><em>David A. Bednar</em></strong></p>
<p>Nephi teaches us, "When a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth [the message] unto the hearts of the children of men" (2 Nephi 33:1). Please notice how the power of the Spirit carries the message <em>unto</em> but not necessarily <em>into</em> the heart. A teacher can explain, demonstrate, persuade, and testify, and do so with great spiritual power and effectiveness. Ultimately, however, the content of a message and the witness of the Holy Ghost penetrate into the heart only if a receiver allows them to enter. &hellip;</p>
<p>A learner exercising agency by acting in accordance with correct principles opens his or her heart to the Holy Ghost-and invites His teaching, testifying power, and confirming witness. Learning by faith requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception. It is in the sincerity and consistency of our faith-inspired action that we indicate to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, our willingness to learn and receive instruction from the Holy Ghost. Thus, learning by faith involves the exercise of moral agency to act upon the assurance of things hoped for and invites the evidence of things not seen from the only true teacher, the Spirit of the Lord. ("Seek Learning by Faith," Address to CES Religious Educators, Feb. 3, 2006, Jordan Institute of Religion)</p>
<p><strong><em>Teaching, No Greater Call</em></strong></p>
<p>"As we teach the gospel, we should humbly recognize that the Holy Ghost is the true teacher. Our privilege is to serve as instruments through whom the Holy Ghost can teach, testify, comfort, and inspire. We should therefore become worthy to receive the Spirit." (<em>Teaching, No Greater Call: A Resource Guide for Gospel Teaching,</em> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999, 41)</p>
