<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This assignment will help you become acquainted with your classmates. Social connections will enhance your learning.</p>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p>If you are new to online learning at BYU-Idaho, read this tutorial to learn <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=50282&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-581580" target="_blank">How to Understand Due Dates</a>. You also might like to upload a profile photo by following <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/I-Learn/New/Upload_Photo.swf" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. Also be aware that in order to post on any discussion board in this course, your computer's language must be set to English for the United States. If you need assistance to change your computer's language, use your computer's help features, search the internet, or contact the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/online/online-support-center" target="_blank">Online Support Center</a> (OSC).</p>]</span></strong> 
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<p>Introduce yourself to the class by clicking on the "Start a New Thread" button, type your name in the subject of your post, and enter the information you would like to share (where you are from, your interests or hobbies, your family, something unique about yourself, etc.).</p>
<p>Along with your introduction, state your perceptions of community health along with what you think are the important components of community health. Complete your post as soon as possible in order to facilitate a robust introductory discussion.</p>
<h3>Step 03</h3>
<p>Read your classmates' posts and select at least two posts to respond to. Open the thread, click the "Reply" button, gather your thoughts, and respond to your classmates' post. Each of your response posts should be more substantial than comments like,"Hi" or, "Nice to meet you." In your response, explain what you have in common, or ask a question/make a comment about something your classmate said. Respond sincerely and enjoy getting to know your classmates. See Calendar for due dates for your initial post and both response posts.</p>
