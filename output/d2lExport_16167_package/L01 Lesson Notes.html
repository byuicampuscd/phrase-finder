<h1>Lesson 01 Notes</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send out an e-mail the first week of class to let your class know that they will hit the ground running with their online class. Here is a sample e-mail you can send out the first week of class:
<ul>
<li>
<span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>[<p style="color: #b30000;"><span style="color: #000000;">"Welcome to ME 201! I'm excited to experience this course with you. We're going to hit the ground running this first week - Lesson 01.</span> Be sure and post your picture to the Personal Information in the "Icebreaker Discussion Board." Click <a href="http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf" style="color: #b30000;" target="_blank">http://stream.byui.edu/tutorials/brainhoney/New/Upload_Photo.swf</a> for a two-minute walkthrough on how to do this. I'll see you in the Icebreaker Discussion Board."</p>]</span></strong> 
</li>
<li>Here are a few other things you might consider including in the introduction e-mail:
<ul>
<li>Information about yourself</li>
<li>A reminder to purchase the course textbook</li>
<li>This week, students will be able to participate in an Icebreaker discussion board. Encourage students to make their initial post earlier in the week; this will make it easier to respond to at least 4 other students' posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To further prepare yourself, make sure that you have the textbook and make sure that you have read through the course material for this week. The more familiar you are with the course and its contents, the better prepared you are to answer student questions.</li>
<li>Be sure that students are aware of the following items (perhaps you could include these instructions in the "Questions and Conversations" or in a class-wide email):
<ul>
<li>Students must complete the ALEKS assessment and submit an image of their pie chart to the ALEKS assignment in the Intro Activities folder before they can progress beyond Lesson 02.</li>
<li>Students who have taken and passed the ALEKS assessment within two semesters can submit those results to complete this requirement. Be watching for emails from these students, and confirm in ALEKS that they have actually completed the quiz at 80%.</li>
<li>In addition to the ALEKS pie chart submission, all Unit 1 practice problems and homework must be complete at 80% before taking the Unit 1 Mastery Quiz in Lesson 02.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>During the Lesson</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is a general "Question and Answer Discussion Board" included in the course but only during the first couple of weeks. Make sure to check this frequently to help students who are either struggling with the material or the technical side of this online course.</li>
<li>You may participate in the Icebreaker Discussion Board, but try not to dominate the discussion.</li>
<li>Make sure students know about your office hours. Be sure to be present in Adobe Connect to visit with students during the hours you have set for yourself. Be prepared to answer student questions via e-mail, office hours, and the Questions and Conversations discussion board.</li>
<li>Log on to <a href="http://www.aleks.com/" target="_blank"> aleks.com</a> to review which students have completed the assessment at an 80% or higher. Use Brother Miller's login:
<ul>
<li>Username: mathphysics</li>
<li>Password: abc1234</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once students have uploaded their pie charts to the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=16167&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-646101" target="_blank">Submit ALEKS Pie Chart</a>&nbsp;assignment, quickly enter a grade for them. You will score the assignment out of 100. Just input whatever overall percent score they achieved on the assessment as a point value. Students will need a grade from you on this assignment before they are able to progress past Lesson 02.</li>
</ul>
